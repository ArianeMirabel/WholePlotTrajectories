<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A cyclic recovery of community composition</h2>
<p>The hump-shaped trajectories of community composition returned towards pre-disturbance state after 30 years, highlighting community resilience in terms of taxonomic and functional composition.</p>
<p>Before disturbance, there were already taxonomic differences among local communities, as revealed by the distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2. These initial differences were maintained throughout the trajectories following disturbance, so community initial state influenced the trajectories following disturbance more than commonly thought. The initial composition indeed partly determined the pool of species recruited, and hence shaped the composition trajectories and drove them towards the recovery of the initial composition. This taxonomic recovery, although it was not fully achieved after 30 years, suggested the resilience of community taxonomic composition and the maintenance of community initial differences <span class="citation">(C. Folke 2006)</span>. Species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were then rarely recruited, probably because of the common dispersal limitations among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Functional composition trajectories were, conversely, highly similar among disturbed communities. As the composition of pre-disturbance surviving trees is representative of the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, changes in functional composition relied upon the recruitment of species or functional types that were infrequent or absent before disturbance. Competitive pioneers became dominant in filling the environmental niches vacated by the disturbance, with a high availability of light, space and nutrients. This recruitment of pioneers similarly changed the functional composition of all communities, whenever the disturbance intensity. The functional composition went towards more resource-acquisitive strategies, translated in the functional plan (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>) by a displacement on the right along the first axis <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Thereafter, the pioneers first recruited were progressively excluded by long-lived, more resistant and shade-tolerant species. The commpunity functional composition then returned towards more resource-conservative strategies, suggesting the recovery of the initial community composition and translated in the functional plan by a displacement left along the first axis and upward along the second axis (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>).</p>
<p>In the light of these taxonomic and functional composition trajectories, community response to disturbance proved simultaneously deterministic and stochastic at different levels of community organization. Taxonomic trajectories were shaped by dispersal limitations maintaining the stochastic differences among communities due to historical contingency. Functional trajectories were shaped by trait-based processes resulting the the convergence of community functional composition <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> A new perspective on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Community taxonomic richness and evenness trajectories were determined by the disturbance intensity, ranging from a limited and temporary impact to significant and persistant alterations of community diversity. The taxonomic trajectories markedly changed above an intensity threshold for which community response corresponded to a maximized richness and a resilience of the evenness. The disturbance intensity determined the balance in the community between pre-disturbance surviving trees, and trees recruited afterward. Below a 20%-25% AGB loss, the trees surviving after disturbance remained numerous enough to maintain the high taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. The recruitment of pionners, infrequent or absent before disturbance, then increased the taxonomic richness all the more so that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Martin2015"><strong>???</strong></span>; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. As these pioneers became more dominant they besides temporarily balanced the usual hyper-dominance of tropical forests, hence temporarily increasing the taxonomic evenness <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. Above the intensity threshold, the taxonomic richness of surviving trees was too low to be offset by the recruitment of pioneers. In the Guiana shield indeed, the pool of true pioneers specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. <em>Cecropia</em> spp., <em>Vismia</em> spp.) <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018)</span>. The richness trajectories following intense disturbance then decreased, all the more so that the disturbance intensity was high <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. At the same time, pioneers became persistently dominant and prevented a return towards the initial evenness and the recovery of hyper-dominant shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Observed trajectories supported the IDH in highlighting a threshold disturbance intensity, expressed as percentage of AGB removed, marking a change in post-disturbance trajectories. Taxonomic trajectories besides highlighted, below the intensity threshold, an intermediate time after when the taxonomic evenness was maximized. This time corresponded to the intermediate between the generation time of pionneers, first to dominate the post-disturbance recruitment, and the time for competitive exclusion, leading to the dominance of late-successional species. As already observed in the Guiana shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Borenan tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>, taxonomic evenness followed humped-shaped trajectories with a peak when the recruitment was balanced between pioneers and late-successional species.</p>
<p>Regarding community functional response in contrast, the IDH seemed disproved. Whenever the disturbance intensity, both community functional richness and evenness increased, with the recruitment of pioneers that were functionally highly different from the species of the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Above the intensity threshold however, for the most intense disturbance, community functional richness and evenness started to decrease after 15 to 20 years. The vacated environmental space was then occupied by short-lived species which prevented the establishment of other species. The decline of these short-lived pioneers decreased the functional richness and evenness, but we suggest that the establishment of long-lasting pioneers will follow and the taxonomic and functional trajectories will catch up with those observed for intermediate disturbance <span class="citation">(L. R. Walker and Moral 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The IDH then translated into community post-disturbance taxonomic trajectories, with marked differences below and above an intensity threshold. It was however not tangible regarding the functional trajectories, because of their decoupling with taxonomic trajectories.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of community resilience</h2>
<p>The decoupling between taxonomic and functional trajectories was explained by a decrease in the functional redundancy within the pre-disturbance functional space, due to the loss of species following disturbance. The recruitment of pioneers, functionally different from the pre-disturbance functional composition, did not compensate the decrease of functional redundancy in the first place. Progressively though, the functional redundancy was restored through the replacement of the first established species by more competitive, long-lived pioneers or late-successional species that were functionally closer to the pre-disturbance community. This replacement followed the lottery recruitment rules, implying a recruitment easy for the first recruited species but increasingly hampered by the emergence of interspecific competition <span class="citation">(Busing and Brokaw 2002)</span>. The functional redundancy then relied upon stochastic processes and its recovery, depending on the recruitment of infrequent species constrained by the increasing competition, was increasingly slow and difficult to anticipate <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The impact of disturbance on community functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of the pre-disturbance communities, with higher chances to see the persistence of disturbance-specific species at the expense of late-successional ones <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008)</span>. Besides, the stochastic recovery of infrequent species increases the risks to lose keystone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Apart from the functional characteristics considered here, infrequent species might indeed have unique functions in the ecosystem or be a key for some fauna <span class="citation">(Schleuning et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
