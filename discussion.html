<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A cyclic recovery of community composition</h2>
<p>Communities taxonomic and functional composition appeared resilient, following similar hump-shaped trajectories starting to return towards pre-disturbance composition after 30 years.</p>
<p>The taxonomic differences among communities, marked before disturbance by the distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2, were maintained throughout recovery trajectories. More than commonly thought, post-disturbance trajectories depended on community initial composition, that partly determined the pool of recruited species and constrained the trajectories towards the initial composition. The high resilience of communities taxonomy revealed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were hardly recruited because of the commonness of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Conversely, disturbed communities followed functional trajecotories similar in terms of functional composition. As pre-disturbance surviving trees mirror the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, changes in functional composition relied upon the recruitment of species or functional types that were infrequent or absent before disturbance. Competitive pioneers became dominant in filling the environmental niches of high availability of light, space and nutrient vacated by the disturbance. The recruitment of pioneers similarly changed community functional composition towards more resource-acquisitive strategies <span class="citation">(Grime 1998; Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Thereafter, again in the same way for all disturbed communities, long-lived, more resistant and shade-tolerant species excluded the first established pioneers and started the recovery of pre-disturbance functional composition.</p>
</div>
<div id="another-perspective-on-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Another perspective on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>The IDH predicted well the disturbance impact on community taxonomic richness, enhanced until an intensity threshold (20-25% AGB loss), and to some extent on taxonomic evenness, somewhat decoupled from the disturbance intensity as already observed in the Guiana Shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Bornean tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>. The disturbance intensity determined the balance in the community between pre-disturbance surviving trees and those recruited afterward. The pool of true pioneer species specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted in the Guiana Shield to a few common genera (e.g. Cecropia spp., Vismia spp.). Below the intensity threshold the size of the surviving community maintained the pre-disturbance taxonomic richness while the recruitment of pioneers, infrequent or absent before disturbance, increased both community taxonomic richness and evenness. Beyond the intensity threshold, the disturbance decreased the taxonomic richness of surviving trees which was not offset by the enrichment of pioneers, so that the overall community taxonomic richness decreased according to the disturbance intensity. For community taxonomic evenness the disturbance impact was similar but slighter, as the evenness is less sensitive to the loss of rare species. Taxonomic evenness rather represented the increasing dominance of pionneers that balanced the usual hyper-dominance of tropical forest below the intensity threshold, thus increasing community overall evenness up to the intensity threshold beyond which pioneers became in turn highly dominant and decreased the overall evenness.</p>
<p>Conversely the IDH was disproved regarding the disturbance impact on community functional diversity. Irrespective of the disturbance intensity the recruitment of pionneers, functionally highly different from the composition of pre-disturbance community, increased the community functional richness and eveness.</p>
<p>Along time, taxonomic richness trajectories for all disturbed communities first dropped similarly following the loss of species during disturbance. Then, trajectories showed a species gain depending on the disturbance intensity. The species gain was all the more significant as the disturbance intensity increased, up to an intensity threshold, through the establishment of long-lived pioneers enhancing community taxonomic richness and evenness in the long term. These long-lived pionneers, functionally quite different from the functional composition, entailed in parallel a progressive and long-lasting increase of the functional diversity. Beyond an intensity threshold, though, a few short-lived pioneers occupied the vacated environmental space and prevented the establishment of other species. These short-lived pioneers were functionally very different from the pre-disturbance community and entailed a rapid and significant increase of functional richness en evenness. Already after 10 years, though, short-lived pioneers started to decline and the functional richness and evenness decreased. Likely the establishment of long-lasting pioneers will follow this decrease and we expect the taxonomic and functional trajectories to catch up with those observed after intermediate disturbance.</p>

<div id="the-functional-redundancy-key-of-community-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of community resilience</h2>
<p>For 15 years the species loss during disturbance, determined by the disturbance intensity, commensurately decreased the functional redundancy within the pre-disturbance functional space. The redundancy decrease was not compensated in the first place as the pionneers first recruited were functionally different from the pre-disturbance functional composition. Progressively though, first established species were replaced by more competitive long-lived pionneers or late-successional species resembling more the pre-disturbance functional composition and restoring the functional redundancy. This replacement was stochastic and followed the lottery recruitment rules, implying a recruitment eased for the first recruited species but then increasingly hampered by the emergence of interspecific competition <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Along time the recovery of infrequent species was increasingly difficult, so that the time for the full recovery of the functional redundancy, in some communities just initiated after 30 years, was difficult to estimate <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The long-term impact of disturbance on community functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of the pre-disturbance communities, with higher chances to see the persistence of disturbance-specific species at the expense of late-successional ones <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>. Besides the long-term recovery of infrequent species increases the risks to loose cornerstone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>. Apart from the functional characteristics considered here, infrequent species might indeed have unique functions in the ecosystem or be a key for some fauna.</p>
