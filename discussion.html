<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A cyclic recovery of community composition</h2>
<p>Communities taxonomic and functional composition appeared resilient, following similar hump-shaped trajectories starting to return towards pre-disturbance composition after 30 years. The taxonomic differences among communities, marked before disturbance by the distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2, were maintained throughout recovery trajectories. More than commonly thought, post-disturbance trajectories depended on community initial composition, that partly determined the pool of recruited species and constrained the trajectories towards the initial composition. The high resilience of communities taxonomy revealed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were hardly recruited because of the commonness of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(SVENNING and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Trajectories of community functional composition appeared similar in time and close in terms of functional composition. Because pre-disturbance surviving trees mirror the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, changes in functional composition relied upon the recruitment of species or functional types infrequent or absent before disturbance. Competitive pioneers became dominant in filling the environmental niches of high availability of light, space and nutrient made available by the disturbance. It changed community functional composition in the same way for all communities, towards more resource-acquisitive strategies <span class="citation">(Grime 1998; Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Later during the community recovery long-lived, more resistant and shade-tolerant species, would exclude those pioneers and restore the pre-disturbance composition.</p>

<div id="another-perspective-on-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Another perspective on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Disturbance clearly enhanced community taxonomic richness until an intensity threshold (20-25% of initial AGB loss), while the taxonomic evenness was somewhat decoupled from the disturbance intensity, as already observed in the Guiana Shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Bornean tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>. The IDH well predicted the response of taxonomic richness to disturbance, and to a lesser extent the taxonomic evenness. Post-disturbance communities combine pre-disturbance surviving trees and recruited trees, either from the remaining pre-disturbance community or from a disturbance-specific community. In the Guiana Shield, the pool of true pioneer species specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. Cecropia spp., Vismia spp.) Below the intensity threshold the taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community is maintained and the recruitment of pioneers, previously infrequent or absent, increases both taxonomic richness and evenness. The disturbance intensity determined the relative importance of pioneers recruited, so the taxonomic richness and evennes increase all the more so that disturbance is intense. However, disturbance in the same time decreases the taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community, and beyond the intensity threshold the decrease exceeds the taxonomic enrichment from pioneers. The taxonomic evenness for its part is less sensitive to the loss of rare species and the disturbance impact is mitigated as pioneers balance the hyper-dominance of undisturbed tropical forests. Conversely the IDH was disproved for the functional diversity. The pioneer species were functionally highly different from the pre-disturbance community composition, so their recruitment increased the community functional richness and eveness after disturbance whenever its intensity.</p>
<p>Community post-disturbance trajectories showed a first drop of the taxonomic richness, similar among communities, followed by a species gain determined by the disturbance intensity. Until an intensity threshold the gain in taxonomic richness increased with the disturbance intensity. This corresponded to the establishment of long-lived pioneers enhancing community taxonomic richness and evenness in the long term. Beyond the intensity threshold a few short-lived pioneers occupied the vacated environmental space, preventing the establishment of further species. The establishment of short-lived pioneers, functionally very different from the pre-disturbance community, rapidly and significantly increased the functional diversity but it started decreasing after 10 years. Below the disturbance intensity threshold on the other hand the establishment of long-lived pionneers entailed a later and lower but long-lasting increase of the functional diversity. Likely the establishment of long-lasting pioneers will follow the decline of short-live pionneers and we expect the taxonomic and functoinal trajectories to catch up with those observed after intermediate disturbance.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of the taxonomic resilience</h2>
<p>The functional redundancy within the pre-disturbance functional space decreased for 15 years because of the loss of species, and was not compensated by the functionally different pionneers. The depth of the redundancy decrease relied on the disturbance intensity that enhanced the initial decrease and the functional differences of pionneers from the pre-disturance composition. After 15 years the first established pioneers pionneers started to be replaced by more competitive long-lived pionneers or late-successional species resembling more the pre-disturbance functional composition and hence increasing the functional redundancy. This replacement though is stochastic and follows the lottery recruitment so because of increasing competition it is increasingly difficult recover pre-disturbance species,specifically the most infrequent ones, as the functional redundancy recovers <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The recovery time proved long as for some community it was just initiated after 30 years but it is thus difficult to estimate <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The long-term impact of disturbance on community functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of pre-disturbance communities and higher chances to see the persistence of disturbance-specific communities, with lower taxonomic richness and more pioneers <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>. Besides the slowed recovery of rare species increased the risks to loose cornerstone specie, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>. Apart from the functional characteristics considered here, infrequent species mighthave unique functions i nthe ecosystem or be a key for some fauna.</p>
