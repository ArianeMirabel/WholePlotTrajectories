<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A cyclic recovery of community composition</h2>
<p>Communities taxonomic and functional composition appeared resilient, following similar hump-shaped trajectories starting to return towards pre-disturbance composition after 30 years. The taxonomic differences among communities, marked before disturbance by the distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2, were maintained throughout recovery trajectories. More than commonly thought, post-disturbance trajectories depended on community initial composition, that partly determined the pool of recruited species and constrained the trajectories towards the initial composition. The high resilience of communities taxonomy revealed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were hardly recruited because of the commonness of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(SVENNING and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Trajectories of community functional composition appeared similar in time and close in terms of functional composition. Because pre-disturbance surviving trees mirror the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, changes in functional composition relied upon the recruitment of species or functional types infrequent or absent before disturbance. Competitive pioneers became dominant in filling the environmental niches of high availability of light, space and nutrient made available by the disturbance. It changed community functional composition in the same way for all communities, towards more resource-acquisitive strategies <span class="citation">(Grime 1998; Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Later during the community recovery long-lived, more resistant and shade-tolerant species, would exclude those pioneers and restore the pre-disturbance composition.</p>

<div id="another-perspective-on-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Another perspective on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Disturbance clearly enhanced community taxonomic richness until an intensity threshold (20-25% of initial AGB loss), while the taxonomic evenness was somewhat decoupled from the disturbance intensity, as already observed in the Guiana Shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Bornean tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>. The IDH well predicted the response of taxonomic richness to disturbance, and to a lesser extent the taxonomic evenness. Post-disturbance communities combine pre-disturbance surviving trees and recruited trees, either from the remaining pre-disturbance community or from a disturbance-specific community. In the Guiana Shield, the pool of true pioneer species specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. Cecropia spp., Vismia spp.) Below the intensity threshold the taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community is maintained and the recruitment of pioneers, previously infrequent or absent, increases both taxonomic richness and evenness. The disturbance intensity determined the relative importance of pioneers recruited, so the taxonomic richness and evennes increase all the more so that disturbance is intense. However, disturbance in the same time decreases the taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community, and beyond the intensity threshold the decrease exceeds the taxonomic enrichment from pioneers. The taxonomic evenness for its part is less sensitive to the loss of rare species and the disturbance impact is mitigated as pioneers balance the hyper-dominance of undisturbed tropical forests.</p>
<p>Conversely the IDH was disproved for the functional diversity. Pioneer species are functionally highly different, and whenever the disturbance intensity their increased abundance suffice to increase the community functional diversity and evenness.</p>
<p>Following disturbance the taxonomic richness droped at first place independently of the disturbance intensity, but then increased through a species gain that was dermined by the disturbance intensity. Below the intensity threshold the establishment of long-lived pioneers significantly enhanced both taxonomic and functional richness and evenness in the long-term. Beyond the intensity threshold the establishment of short-lived pioneers rapidly filling the environmental space made available did not increased the taxonomic richness and entailed a decrease in the functional diversity after 10 years. Likely, after intense disturbance the long-lived pioneers will succeed and post-disturbance trajectories will match those of intermediate disturbance, which explains the decoupling in time between high and low disturbance intensity trajectories.</p>
<p>Species first established after disturbance remained in the community but became less dominant, replaced the abundant pre-disturbance species, but the recovery of rare species was hampered in the long-term <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; J. Chave 2004)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-functional-redundancy-key-of-the-taxonomic-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of the taxonomic resilience</h2>
<p>The recovery of the most infrequent species followed the lottery recruitment rules <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and was hampered by the increasing competition among species, implying long term recovery <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Following disturbance the space and resources made available corresponded to a rapid decrease of the functional redundancy within the initial functional space. The high light, space and nutrient niches were rapidly filled by species, mainly the most dominant and frequent ones. Thereafter competitive exclusion emerged following the filling of the niches and limited the recruitment of infrequent species <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The recovery of communities taxonomic richness and evenness relied upon the recovery of the initial functional redudancy. Although underway 30 years after disturbance the recovery remained unachieved and after 30 years the recovery it was underway but remained unachieved. This alteration of the functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of pre-disturbance communities and higher chances to see the persistence of disturbance-specific communities, with less species and more pioneers <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>. Besides the slowed recovery of rare species increased the risks to loose cornerstone specie, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>. Apart from the functional characteristics considered here, infrequent species mighthave unique functions i nthe ecosystem or be a key for some fauna.</p>
