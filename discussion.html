<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decoupled recovery of communities taxonomic and functional characteristics</h2>
<p>Both communities taxonomic and functional diversity and composition proved resilient, following similar humped-back trajectories with a return towards initial values. The resilience of communities functional characteristics, the most direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, meant a consistent recovery of ecosystem processes in the long term <span class="citation">(Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. The resilience of communities taxonomic characteristics, in turn, meant the maintenance of their initial differences in composition and structure. It suggested that communities response to disturbance were somehow constraint to converge towards determined compositions <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Anderson 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Although both communities taxonomic and functional characteristics proved resilient and followed similar humped-back trajectories, the taxonomic recovery systematically lagged behind the corresponding functional dynamics. Such delay between functional and taxonomic dynamics has already been observed for grasslands <span class="citation">(D. Tilman 1997; D. Mouillot et al. 2011)</span> and more recently for tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. According to the “vegetation quantity effect” <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span> functional trajectories rely on the pool of dominant species, which diversity and evenness were enhanced after disturbance, and which rapidly restored the functional diversity and composition. However, communities evenness remained high so infrequent species still missed to the taxonomic recovery that mechanically lagged behind, all the more so that unrecovered species would be functionally redundant and probably undergo competition processes.</p>

<div id="a-validation-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> A validation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Validating the IDH, communities trajectories confirmed the diversity increase after disturbance through an enhanced growth of otherwise less favored species. This was however completely clear regarding the functional diversity but much more blurry for communities taxonomic characteristics.</p>
<p>The taxonomic richness was weakly or negatively impacted by intense disturbance, as observed on several post logging surveys <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>, while it substantially increased after low intensity disturbance. Disturbance also enhanced taxonomic evenness, but its intensity was only weakly and lately correlated to communities eveness (<em>i.e.</em> Simpson diversity). Contrastingly, disturbance intensity consistently predicted the significant increase of communities functional diversity for 30 years. Disturbance impacts involve specific turnover within communities, either among pre-disturbance survivors or among newly recruited trees. As the composition of old-growth survivors proved to mirror initial communities <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, disturbance would impact trees recruitment through the enhanced growth and survival of previously infrequent species and functional characteristics. Consistently, disturbance resulted in increasing taxonomic dissimilarity compared to pre-disturbance communities and functional shifts towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf toughness and maximum height) <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Disturbance then caused a reorganization of the typical high dominance structure of hyperdiverse mature forests after disturbance, benefiting to pioneers and light demanding species. Likely, the changes in abiotic environment and competitive pressure favored pioneers which outcompete others in non limiting resources but are excluded in mature forests by long-lived, more resistant and shade tolerant species. Therefore, consistently with communities dynamics after disturbance relied on species functional strategy and corresponding ability to fill the environmental niches made available by disturbance. Recruited species then mixed with pre-disturbance ones, from which they differed, and constituted a community all the more diversified that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-functional-redundancu-and-the-resilience-of-communities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancu and the resilience of communities</h2>
<p>Both the lag between taxonomic and functional recovery and the middling consistency of the IDH regarding communities taxonomic diversity entail a central role of functional redundancy. Functional redundancy, determinant of communities resilience <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, seemed not to have recovered 30 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>Although disturbance would be mitigated by communities functional redundancy, we expect the redundancy itself to be reduced or re-organized within the functional space. Globally, disturbed communities did not follow consistent trajectories after disturbance and 30 years after disturbance, irrespective of the intensity, disturbed communities displayed lower, similar or higher functional redundancy. The redundancy within the functional space of the initial community however clearly followed humped-back trajectories which decrease was determined by the disturbance intensity and which return to initial state was not observed for any disturbed community. Not only did the functional redundancy and hence the resilience of pre-disturbance community decrease, but also did the ones of disturbance-specific communities increase. It means higher chances to have long lasting or self-maintained compositional changes towards disturbance resistant species, lianas or epiphytes <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span> and thus highly question forest’s resilience <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2003)</span>. Specificaly, this would impair species contingent to undisturbed forests, threatening their maintenance, and run the risk to loose cornerstone species and trigger unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
