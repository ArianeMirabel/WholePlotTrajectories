# Introduction
The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial economic, social and cultural value. 
They provide not only wood but also multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate local climate and support carbon, water and many nutrient cycles and ensure cultural and human well-being. The increasing demand for forests products and the resulting shrink of unmanaged areas increase the pressure on the remaining intact forest landscapes as well as threaten the maintenance of their structure, composition and functionning in the long term. 
The increasing demand for forests products, land-use changes and other human disturbances along with substantial climatic changes make a crucial issue of understanding the response of forests dynamics to such disturbance regimes [@Gibson2011a; @Morales-Hidalgo2015]. 
This has been addressed from the point of view of biomass production and carbon storage which resilience proved subjected to identified cyclic dynamics and therefore gives hope for the maintenance of forest ecosystem and their services. 
The response of trees biological diversity however has been sparsely studied, although this diversity is a major determinant of forests productivity, stability and functioning as it ensures interspecific complementarity, enhances the use of resources and the store of nutrients, and mitigates the prejudices of diseases and herbivory [@Tilman2014]. 
Maintain the integrity of forests functioning thus requires highlighting the impacts and underlying mechanisms of disturbance on trees diversity and question the extent of forests resilience. 

Disturbance is defined as rapid changes in the amount and allocation of resources such as variation in the availability of light, the fluxes of heat and water, etc. 
It influences the environment and competition among species and combineds with environmental filters that select the pool of species fitting the environmental context to shape the composition and structure of communities in the long term: understanding ecosystems requires understanding their disturbance history [@White2001]. 
Although those changes proved impacting the proportion and identity of species, negligible or even positive impacts were highlighted when considering the community as a whole, in accordance with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). 
The IDH that predicts a maximized species diversity at intermediate level of disturbance, however, mainly rely on the study of species richness which gives limited or even misleading information on forests recovery and functioning.
The mechanisms under which disturbance shapes communities diversity and structure involve the foster of certain species either stachastically, through the recruitment and dispersal limitation [@Hubbell1999] or determinisitcally through the selection of suited ecological types.
Such deterministic selection is though to be driven by the trade-off between rapid growth and resources acquisition, therefore "acquisitive strategies" and slow growth with scarce resources [].
A way to disentangle the mechanisms of disturbance dynamics would then to identify the shifts in communities functional types definde by the acquisitive or conservative functional traits and by the reproductive strategy through seed and early stage traits [@TerSteege2001;@Reich2014;@Herault2011].
Relevant functional types would be defined with the combination of resource acquisition traits: in that respect leaf and stem traits proved relevant in a large litterature [@Chave2009b;@Wright2004],and life history traits revealing the growth and reproductive strategy [@Westoby1998;@Herault2011]
Beyond diversity indices it is essential to analyse changes in taxonomic composition so that the impact on species per se and their particular impact on ecosystem can be followed [@╔Lavorel2002;@Bellwood;@Baraloto2012] along with the ecological rules shaping communities assembly and abundance distribution [@Magurran??].


Such combination of composition and diversity in browsing all facets of stands assemblage would highlight their resilience to perturbation, and its determinant and underlying ecological processes.
Disturbance survey would first assess species turnover and communities convergence through stands taxonomic composition and unveil environmental filters through functional composition that is based on the biological attributes of plants. 
The set of functional traits chosen for this functional analysis considers functional traits representative of species functional strategy, fitness, and ecology as it is the case for traits of the leaf or stem economics.
Composition analysis would be continued with diversity analysis assessing for the whole community the richness and evenness of the taxonomic and functional abundance distribution.   
Here we examined the long-term trajectory, in the sense of the evolution along time, of tropical forests taxonomic and functional composition and diversity. 
We studied the regular inventories over 30 years of twelve Amazonian forest plots, either untouched or disturbed with three disturbance intensity . 
The inventories were combined with one of the largest functional trait database for tropical trees. We aimed to (i) explicit the impact of disturbance on the long-term trajectory of tropical forest communities composition and diversity, (ii) question the long-term convergence of the composition of communities and (iii) determine their resilience or not, after disturbance.


# Material and Methods

### Study site 
Paracou station in French Guiana (5°18'N and 52°53'W) is located in a lowland tropical rain forest corresponding to a tropical wet climate with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y^-1^ (30-y period) with a 3-months dry season (< 100 mm.months^-1^) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March [@Wagner2011]. 
Elevation ranges between 5 and 50 m and mean annual temperature is 26°C. 
Soils correspond to thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability generating lateral drainage during heavy rains.
The experiment corresponds to a network of twelve 6.25ha plots that have undergone a gradient of three logging, thinning and fuelwood treatments.
Disturbance treatments were attributed according to a randomized plot design with three replicate blocks of four plots. 
The disturbance corresponds to averages of 10 trees removed per hectare with a diameter at 1.3 m height (DBH) above 50 cm for treatment 1 (T1), 32 trees/ha above 40 cm DBH for treatment 2 (T2) and 40 trees above 40 cm DBH for treatment 3 (T3). 
Treatments T2 and T3 besides included the thinning of trees by poison girdling [@Blanc2009].

### Inventories protocol and dataset correction
The study site corresponds to a tropical rain forest with a dominance of Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae. 
In the twelve experimental plots of the experiment, all trees above 10 cm DBH are mapped and measured annually since 1984. 
During the inventories, trees are first identified with a vernacular name, assigned by the field team, and then with a scientific name, assigned by a botanist during regular botanical campaigns. 
In 1984, specific vernacular names were given to 62 commercial or common species whereas two identifiers separating palm trees and trees were given to all other species. 
The botanical campaigns to identify all trees at the species level started in 2003 and continued every 5 to 6 years.
This inventory protocol rasied some mehodological issues given the variability of botanical identification practices along time and among plots. 
Because vernacular name attributed to trees usually correspond to a variety of botanical species, some taxonomic uncertainty remains whenever a trustworthy botanical name cannot be given thereafter. 
This taxonomic uncertainty was accounted for in the composition and diversity metrics throught a Bayesian framework estimating the expectancy and variance of composition and diversity metrics. 
The uncertainty propagation is done by the extrapolation of complete inventories at genus level from real incomplete inventories, on the basis vernacular names replacement. The replacement of vernacular names uses a multinomial distribution M~v~([*s~1~, s~2~, …, s~N~*] ,[*α~1~, α~2~,…, α~N~*]) based on the observed association probability [*α~1~, α~2~,…, α~N~*] between each vernacular name *v* and the species [*s~1~, s~2~, …, s~N~*] recorded in the inventory.
See appendix 1 and @Aubry-Kientz2013 for the detailed methodology.

The functional metrics used a set of 6 functional traits values representing traits of the leaf and wood economics and life history traits.
The trait database encompassed 4 traits of the leaves: leaves thickness (*L_thick*), toughness (*L_tough*), total chlorophyll content (*LCC*) and specific leaf area (leaf area per unit dry mass; *SLA*), 2 traits of the stem: wood specific gravity (*SWG*) and bark thickness (*B_thick)* and two life-history traits: maximum specific height (*Hmax*) and the seed mass (*Smass*). 
Traits database came from the BRIDGE project (http://www.ecofog.gf/Bridge/index.html) where traits values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou.
To account for intraspecific traits variability, trait values at species level were assessed in sampling one of the measured individuals for iteration rather than averaging at species level. 
Missing trait values were filled using multivariate imputation by chained equation (mice), restricted to the samples pertaining to the next higher taxonomic level, in order to account for the phylogenetic signal of the functional traits. 
The dataset comprised 257 botanical species. Whenever a species inventoried was not in the dataset, it was attributed a set of traits values randomly sampled among species of the same next higher taxonomic level. 
All composition and diversity metrics correspond to the expectancy obtained after 50 iterations of the taxonomic uncertainty propagation framework and the missing trait values filling process. 


### Composition and diversity metrics

The analysis of taxonomic and functional composition of plots along time was visualized in a two-dimensional ordination space based on non-metric dimensional scaling of succesive floristic or functional inventories. 
Plots evolution along time was reportedcomparatively to the inventories in 1989, 5 years after disturbance, which correspond to first inventory with a sufficient degree of uncertainty (<30% of undetermined trees). The distancing relative to the reference 1989 inventory was reported using occurrence-based (Jaccard) and abundance-based (Bray-Curtis) similarity measures. 
The euclidean distance in the two-dimensional ordination space was used to visualize the distancing to reference inventory along time.
The functional composition was besides completed by trajectory along time of the community weighted means (CWM) for the 8 leaf, stem and life history traits. 
To determine whether communities’ assembly deviated from the expectation of a random process we compared the observed similarity patterns to those generated by 50 repetitions of stochastic null models. 
The null model for taxonomic composition randomly shuffled individuals among plots while preserving the overall species abundance and plots’ tree density. 
The null model for functional composition produced random traits assemblages by permuting the set of functional traits values among species. 

Plots taxonomic diversity corresponded to species Richness and the Hill number translation of Shannon and Simpson indices. 
These three indices belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0, 1 and 2 order of diversity (q). 
This order q grasps the balance between richness and evenness in the community as it determines the weight of common species in the diversity metric, with an growing emphasis on dominant species as q increases. 
The functional diversity was reported using the Rao index of quadratic entropy which combines species abundance distribution and average pairwise dissimilarity based on the 6 functional traits specific values.

# Results

Over time, 104423 trees and 696 botanical species were recorded. 
The disturbance proved to significantly impact for more than 30 years the functional and taxonomic composition and diversity of the stands. 
 
### Taxonomic and functional composition
 
*Composition trajectories* _ Trajectories of taxonomic and functional composition after disturbance were examined through the ordination of successive inventories from 1989 (5 years after disturbance) in a two-dimensional space based on NMDS analysis. 
Classifications were based on either abundance-based Bray-Curtis \autoref{Fig1} or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity (data not shown).

Both taxonomic and functional composition were substantially affected by disturbance and positively correlated with its intensity.
*The distance from the initial condition was significantly time-dependent (P<0.01).* 
The taxonomic composition remained significantly different from the 1989 reference inventory until 30 years for all disturbed plots \autoref{Fig1}. 
From 20 years after disturbance, though, the distancing decreased which suggested a return toward the reference 1989 inventory and its resilience to disturbance \autoref{Fig1},\autoref{Fig2}. 
The functional composition distancing from the reference inventory was also positively correlated with disturbance intensity and similarly stabilized or reduced (for 5 of T1, T2 and T3 plots) from 20 years after disturbance \autoref{Fig2}. 
*The coordinates of the functional traits were measured in the two-dimensional ordination space that mapped plots evolution along time (graphs not showed) which revealed that the trajectories of disturbed plots along time headed toward acquisitive functional strategies (from high SWG to high SLA and chlorophyll content).*

### Disturbance impact on diversity

*Taxonomic diversity* _ Trajectories of Richness, Shannon and Simpson taxonomic diversity were examined in relation to the 1994 inventories \autoref{Fig4}. 
*For the three indices the OLS regression confirmed the time-dependency of the diversity variations (P<0.01) and a covariance analysis confirmed the significant effect of the disturbance treatment (P<0.01).*

The evolution along time of the difference of Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity compared to reference inventories in 1989 remained even for 30 years after disturbance for the control plots whereas disturbed plots showed significant increase, positively correlated with the disturbance intensity \autoref{Fig4}. 
The richness stabilized for all disturbed plots from 20 years after disturbance \autoref{Fig4}. 
The Shannon and Simpson diversity also stabilized 20 years after disturbance for T1 and T2 plots \autoref{Fig4} whereas for 2 out of 3 plots T3 the Shannon and Simpson diversity continued increasing until 30 years after disturbance, illustrating a significant increase in communities’ evenness.

*Functional  diversity* _ The evolution along time of the Rao functinal diversity compared to reference inventories in 1989 remained even all along the survey for the control plots. 
All disturbed plots however showed an increase of the functional diversity that was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity \autoref{Fig5}. 30 after disturbance the diversity of disturbed plots remained significantly higher than this of control plots, thus whenever the initial disturbance intensity.
The slope of the initial diversity increase and the maximum diversity were both positively correlated with the disturbance intensity. 
*The OLS regression confirmed the time-dependency of the diversity variations (P<0.01) and the covariance analysis confirmed the significant effect of the disturbance treatment (P<0.01)*.
The trajectories of plot 7 from the T1 disturbance treatment was discarded because of too high taxonomic uncertainty preventing correct analysis.

# Discussion

-	The disturbance significantly impact the functional and taxonomic composition and diversity of the stands for more than 30 years. 
> Question Hubbel vs. Molino: IDH or not, if the composition is affected the changes are oriented then the IDH is valid.
> Recovery of the composition, as in storm regime [@Burslem2000] the recovery is probably due to the coexistence of species. It is consistent with the seed characteristics that have high mass and then short dispersion distance

-	Important differences among plots of same treatments: possible impact of initial diversity composition, local abiotic parameters (topography, soils, surrounding stands). Impacts depend on the disturbance intensity, but further parameters may be involved. 

-	The shift in functional composition differs from the null model: biotic and abiotic filters are at stake but only tangible from 10/15 years after logging. 
> Discussion with Cannon, 1998: they found no different process than rarefaction for 8 years after logging, but the time might have been too short -> divergence due to recruitment and not rarefaction after random species disappearance. Same conclusions otherwise.
> hubbel stop the observation 13 years after disturbance, which is very short [@Hubbell1999;@Sheil2003], and according to our observatoin this is not the peak period yet

-	Disturbance involves new filters for species settling in the stands, probably according to their functional strategy. Disturbance generates a functional shift of communities toward acquisitive strategies. Ecosystems function rely on abundant species: changes in stands functioning is then expected.  
> (Flores, 2006  for differential sapling success after disturbance)
> typical pattern of the IDH [@Sheil2003] with an initial rise of the diversity followed by a decline through compoetitive domination. IDH is a regression to previous successional states and the more intense the logging the further we go back.The overall diversit increases because the IDH is patchy
> Acquisitive like functional traits associated with higher diversity and disturbance dynamics [@TerSteege2001]. Increase in functional diversity correlated with shifts toward more disturbance-like functional traits.

- Functional and taxonomic trajectories don't follow the same trajectories. Functional redundancy [biblio to be found] and contrasting taxonomic and functional response to disturbane[@Baraloto2012 and ref therein]. Ecosystem functioning is altered differently by disturbance than communities composition. Such difference could be explained by competitive exclusion at stake in control plots and not after disturbance.
Baraloto showed that evenness of functional diversity was affected: resilience may be altered for future disturbance

-	If the recovery is not achieved 30 years after disturbance, it is on the way to. Only one plot displayed a still increasing Simpson diversity, and all plots showed a stabilization or a decrease of the composition distancing from 1989 inventories. however this is the impact of a single disturbance event: the repetition may have different impact (@Olander2005 demonstrated the impact of logging on soils nutrient and compaction)
> the IDH involves a unimodal response to disturbance [@Sheil2003] and the functional strategy follows this pattern, however the composition still didn't recover,neither did the taxo diversity. Functioning recovering faster than taxo?

-	To go further we should focus on recruitment which would also highlight the mechanisms underlying these shifts and dynamics and explicit the environmental filter.
> Discussion about the composition impact: do we regenerate SB and species from old-growth forest (see [@Sheil2003] for discussion).
