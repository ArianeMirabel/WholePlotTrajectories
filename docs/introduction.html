Anticipate the impact of the global change context on tropical forests is now urgent. This calls to highlight the taxonomic and functional facets of tree community post-disturbance trajectories and the underlying processes. It also calls to clarify the link between biodiversity and disturbance, specifically the scope of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) that is debated in tropical forests. In this study, we analyzed the tree community trajectories following a disturbance gradient in a Neotropical forest over 30 years. We considered community taxonomic and functional diversity, composition and redundancy trajectories. We based on the annual botanical inventories of 75 ha of a Neotropical forest and on large trait datasets comprising 7 leaf, stem and life-history traits. We highlighted a decoupling between taxonomic trajectories, that differed among communities, and functional trajectories, remained similar and convergent. We explained this decoupling by the variations in community functional redundancy that mitigated the functional impact of disturbance. Post-disturbance trajectories clarified the scope of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis that was validated regarding taxonomic diversity, with an intensity threshold of 20-25%, but not regarding functional diversity.The IDH applied around 20 years after disturbance when the recruitment of pioneers and late-successionals were balanced. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years. This acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles without disturbance to ensure a complete recovery, and questioned tropical forest community resilience after repeated disturbances.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, and ensure cultural and human well-being. They regulate as well the local and regional climates, and the carbon, water and nutrient cycles. However, the growing demand in forests products together with current global changes increase the pressure on remaining natural undisturbed forests <span class="citation">(Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>. These threats affect the disturbance regime that naturally shapes and maintains the structure, composition and functioning of tree communities <span class="citation">(Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>. To anticipate the fate of tropical forests in this context, understanding the response of communities to disturbance and deciphering the underlying ecological processes is of utmost importance. Disturbance impacts forest communities in changing both abiotic and biotic environments, through modifications in the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>. Although the forest cover is generally maintained after disturbance, there is a succession of changes in the structure and functioning of ecological communities that defines a post-disturbance ecosystem trajectory. For now, these trajectories have been largely studied through trajectories of forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Recent works have identified some of the determinants of post-disturbance biomass trajectories, like pre-disturbance forest structure and composition or post-disturbance environmental parameters <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Regarding tree community diversity and composition however, post-disturbance trajectories have not been as thoroughly understood <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Given the variety of species response to disturbance and the huge diversity of tropical forests, manifold post-disturbance biodiversity trajectories might emerge <span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012; Garcia Florez et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>An early conceptual basis of the linkage between biodiversity and disturbance is the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). The IDH assumes a relationship between community diversity and the intensity and frequency of disturbance events, stating that community diversity peaks at intermediate level of disturbance <span class="citation">(Connell 1978)</span>. The theory assumes that the environmental fluctuations following disturbance foster both competitively superior species and fast colonizers and thus prevent competitive exclusion <span class="citation">(Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Pulsford, Lindenmayer, and Driscoll 2016)</span>. In tropical forests, however, observations of the IDH often diverge from theoretical expectations <span class="citation">(Randall Hughes et al. 2007; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Norden et al. 2017)</span>, and the validation of the theory remains controversial <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Fox 2013; Sheil and Burslem 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we argue that there is a need to delineate the scope of the IDH in time, using ecosystem time-explicit trajectories, and highlight the moment when the conditions for the IDH emerge <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004)</span>. Indeed, the link between biodiversity, IDH and post-disturbance disturbance trajectories might be complicated by the huge diversity found in tropical tree communities and the variety of ecological processes that may underlie the IDH (colonization, facilitation, coexistence, etc)<span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012; Garcia Florez et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Analysing community response to disturbance requires a set of metrics, to grasp all aspects of community changes <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>. The analysis should first consider community composition, which is crucial for conservation issues and which reveals the pool of species fostered (or hampered) by disturbance <span class="citation">(S. Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>. Then, diversity metrics encompassing both richness and evenness should also be considered to assess the changes in community abundance distribution. Besides, functional approaches have been shown to usefully complement pure taxonomic approaches because they shed light on the species biological attributes that directly link community diversity, composition and redundancy to ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. In that respect, a vast literature allowed recognizing major traits that represent species ecological strategy and determine how they respond to changing conditions <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Specifically in tropical forests, the functional approach revealed the post-disturbance deterministic processes entailing a shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources, to a dominance of “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into the trajectories of average community value of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf and stem traits) and life-history strategy (seed mass, maximum size) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The functional approach also encompasses the analysis of functional redundancy, that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The typical high functional redundancy of hyper-diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines communities resilience after disturbance <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition and redundancy. Specifically, (i) we draw taxonomic and functional post-disturbance trajectories and examine the underlying ecological process, (ii) we discuss the scope of the IDH regarding the different facets of community diversity and the time after disturbance, and (iii) we analyze community resilience and time to recovery.</p>
