<p>Understand the maintenance of forests biodiversity structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global changing context. Communities diversity structure is assumed to rely on a constant regime of disturbance and peak at intermediate intensity. For tropical forests this intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) remain debated as well as the completeness of forests resilience in all taxonomic and functoinal facets. To disentangle the ecological processes driving forests dynamics we examined the the trajectories over 30 years after a gradient of logging and thinning disturbance, focusing on communities taxonomic and functional composition and diversity. Specifically we analysed the trajectories of communities taxonomic richness and evennes and functional composition, diversity and redundancy based on 7 key functional traits assessing species ecology. We highlighted a decoupling between functional and taxonomic trajectories, translating a fast recovery of communities functioning while their taxonomic recovery was slowed by the recruitment of infrequent species specific to mature forests. The IDH consistently predicted communities functional trajectories but poorly reflected the taxonomic ones, blurried by changes in the functional redundancy entailing competitive exclusion. Although communities consistently recovered their functioning after 30 years, initially infrequent species proved long to recover which impacted the taxonomic structure and functoinal redundancy over several decades. Our results acknowledged the need of decades-long recovery cycles to restore the resilience of the community and prevent species loss in the long term.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate the local climate, support the carbon, water and nutrient cycles, and ensure cultural and human well-being. The simultaneous increased demand in forests products and the substantial climatic changes currently heighten the pressure on remaining forests <span class="citation">(Gibson et al. 2011; Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>, threatening the maintenance of communities structure, composition and functioning and their dynamics in space and time <span class="citation">(Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In tropical forest, ecological communities are constantly re-shaped by natural disturbance events that change both abiotic environment, through the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>, and biotic interactions like competition among species <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. The cornerstone of tropical forests ecology is to understand the mechanisms and the determinants of ecosystems response to disturbance <span class="citation">(White and Jentsch 2001; Chazdon 2003)</span>. For now, this has been largely studied through structural parameters, rapid and convenient to measure, as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. These structural parameters were thereafter sucessfully modeled, giving important insights into the maintenance of ecosystems processes and services <span class="citation">(Denslow and Guzman 2000; Blanc et al. 2009)</span>. However the response of forests diversity in tree species remains unclear, albeit it determines the productivity, stability and functioning of ecosystems <span class="citation">(David Tilman, Isbell, and Cowles 2014, <span class="citation">Liang et al. (2016)</span>)</span> and would be most probably impacted by the changes following disturbance <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>In the short-term disturbance demonstrated negligible or even positive impacts on communities diversity, which have been formalized by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) stating a maximized species diversity at intermediate disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Kariuki et al. 2006; Berry et al. 2008)</span>. Still, validations of the IDH remain scarce in the long term and mainly rely on species richness analyses that give limited or misleading information on forests recovery and functioning <span class="citation">(Philip A. Martin et al. 2015; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. More releveant monitoring would encompass communities composition, crucial for conservation issues, and complete diversity profiles integrating both species richness and evenness, to reveal the ecological rules structuring communities <span class="citation">(Magurran 1988; Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>. Furthermore, the functional approach that accounts for species biological attributes and role in the ecosystem would be essential to understand the correlations between ecosystems biodiversity, functioning and environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Moretti et al. 2009; Baraloto et al. 2012; Scheiter, Langan, and Higgins 2013)</span>. The functional trait-based approach focused on major traits related to species ecology and performance was sucessfully adopted <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Villéger, Mason, and Mouillot 2008)</span>, for example in highlighting deterministic processes in tropical rainforests that foster fast growing species with efficient resources acquisition after disturbance <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Haddad et al. 2008; Rüger et al. 2009)</span>. Communities then shifted from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources to “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(TerSteege and Hammond 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift translated into consistent trajectories for key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf area, density and chlorophyll content, and stem specific gravity and bark thickness), tree growth and reproduction and life history traits (seed mass and maximum height) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>A combination of taxonomic and functional approaches are essential to fully assess communities response to disturbance and differences in their respective trajectories are insightful of underlying mechanisms <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. Although taxonomic and functional diversity are complementary and sometimes decouples, they are combined in the measure of communities functional redundancy that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. Functional redundancy is determinant of communities resilience as high redundancy, like in highly diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>, mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Grasp all facets of communities response to disturbance comes to examine the taxonomic and functional trajectories in diversity and composition. These trajectories would highlight the ecological rules constraining or not communities dynamics towards the recovery of initial composition, diversity and functioning. They would therefore clarify the tenants in the long term of the debated Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis for tropical forests, a cruicial point for future adaptive conservation strategies <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. Here we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of forests plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of ecosystem biomass removed. We made use of a large functional traits database browsing major leaf, stem and seed functional traits and species maximum height to draw the trajectories over time of communities taxonomic and functional composition and diversity. Specifically, we (i) questioned the coupling between taxonomic and functional response to disturbance and identified the underlying assembly processes, which allowed to (ii) clarify the validity of the IDH in the long term for tropical forest and (iii) question the completeness of communities recovery regarding their functional redundancy.</p>
