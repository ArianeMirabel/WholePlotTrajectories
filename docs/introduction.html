Understanding the ecological rules underlying the maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global change context. The huge diversity of tropical forests is often assumed to be regularly reshaped by natural disturbance yielding a diversity peak at intermediate intensity. This intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), though, remains debated and the resilience of community taxonomic and functional diversity and composition remains controversial. To disentangle the ecological processes driving community response to disturbance, we analyzed tree community trajectories following a disturbance gradient in a Neotropical forest. We examined community diversity, composition and redundancy trajectories over 30 years, considering both taxonomic and functional trajectories based on 7 leaf, stem and life-history traits. We highlighted the cyclic recovery of community taxonomic and functional composition. While pre-disturbance taxonomic differences were maintained over time, functional composition trajectories were quite similar among communities. The IDH did predict community taxonomic diversity response while functional diversity was enhanced whatever the disturbance intensity. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years. This acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles with no disturbance to ensure a complete recovery, and questioned tropical forest community resilience after repeated disturbances.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, and ensure cultural and human well-being. They regulate as well the local and regional climates, and the carbon, water and nutrient cycles. However, the growing demand in forests products together with current global changes increase the pressure on remaining natural forests <span class="citation">(Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>. These threats affect the natural disturbance regime that shape and maintain the structure, composition and functioning of tree communities <span class="citation">(Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>. It is urgent to understand community response to disturbance and the processes underlying to anticipate the fate of tropical forests in the current context. Disturbance change both community abiotic and biotic environments, through modifications in the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>. In tropical forests, the forest environment is maintained after disturbance and there is a suit of changes in the structure and functioning of communities that consitutes a secondary succession. For now, this succession has been largely studied through post-disturbance trajectories of forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Models based on observed trajectories then assessed community time to recovery and identified some of the determinants of post-disturbance trajectories, like forest structure, forest composition, environmental parameters and disturbance characteristics <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Regarding community diversity and composition, however, post-disturbance trajectories have not been as thoroughly understood <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Given the variety of species response to disturbance and the huge diversity of tropical forests, post-disturbance biodiversity trajectories might be very diverse <span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012; Garcia_Florez et al. 2017)</span>. It is essential to anticipate these trajectories, and hence to highlight the link between biodiversity and disturbance, specifically how disturbance intensity and frequency determine the rate, endpoint and duration of the trajectories <span class="citation">(R. L. Chazdon 2003; Willig and Presley 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>An early conceptual basis of the linkage between biodiversity and disturbance is the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). The IDH assumes a relationship between community diversity and the intensity and frequency of disturbance events <span class="citation">(Connell 1978)</span>. The theory and states that community diversity peaks at intermediate level of disturbance. The fluctuations of environmental conditions after disturbance are assumed to prevent competitive exclusion in fostering both competitively superior species and fast colonizers <span class="citation">(Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Pulsford, Lindenmayer, and Driscoll 2016)</span>. In tropical forests, however, observations of the IDH are often blurry compared to theoretical expectations <span class="citation">(Randall Hughes et al. 2007; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Norden et al. 2017)</span>, and the validation of the theory remains controversial <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Fox 2013; Sheil and Burslem 2013)</span>. The link between biodiversity and disturbance might be complicated by the huge diversity of tropical communities and by the variety of ecological processes that may underlie the IDH (colonisation, facilitation, coexistence,etc)<span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012; Garcia_Florez et al. 2017)</span>. The scope of the IDH need be clarified regarding the different facets of community diversity, like taxonomic richness, abundance distribution and functioning. Besides, the question is highlighting the moment when emerge the conditions for the IDH, which would be an intermediate time after disturbance. In this study we then aimed to clarify the scope of the IDH in time and regarding the different facets of community diversity <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>The analyse of community response to disturbance requires a set of metrics, to grasp all aspects of community changes <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>. The analysis should first consider community composition, which is crucial for conservation issues <span class="citation">(S. Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> and assesses the different species fostered by the disturbance. Diversity metrics encompassing taxonomic richness and evenness would assess the changes community abundance distribution. A functional approach accounting for species biological attributes and ecological strategy, would directly link community diversity, composition and redundancy to ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. In that respect, a vast literature allowed recognizing major traits that represent species ecological strategy and determine how they respond to changing conditions <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Specifically in tropical forests, the functional approach revealed the post-disturbance deterministic processes entailing a shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources, to a dominance of “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into the trajectories of average community value of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf and stem traits) and life-history strategy (seed mass, maximum size) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>. The functional approach also encompasses the analysis of functional redundancy, that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The high functional redundancy of hyper-diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines the resilience of communities after disturbance <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition and redundancy. Specifically, (i) we defined taxonomic and functional post-disturbance trajectories and examined the underlying ecological process, (ii) we discussed the scope of the IDH regarding the different facets of community diversity and regarding time after disturbance, and (iii) we analyzed community resilience and time to recovery.</p>
