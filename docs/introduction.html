<p>Understanding the ecological rules underlying the maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global change context. The huge diversity of tropical forests is often assumed to be regularly reshaped by natural disturbance yielding a diversity peak at intermediate intensity, but this intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) remains debated, and this controversy also questions the extent of communities resilience regarding their functional and taxonomic facets. To disentangle the ecological processes driving community response to disturbance, we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity trajectories following a disturbance gradient. Specifically, we examined, over 30 years, the functional and taxonomic community trajectories with regards to diversity, composition and redundancy. Functional trajectories were drawn based on 7 leaf, stem and life-history traits. We highlighted the cyclic recovery of community taxonomic and functional composition. The pre-disturbance taxonomic differences were maintained over time while the functional composition trajectories were quite similar. The IDH did predict communities functional diversity response while taxonomic diversity remained poorly sensitive to disturbance intensity. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years. This acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles with no disturbance to ensure a complete recovery, and questioned tropical forest community resilience after repeated disturbance.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate the local and regional climates, the carbon, water and nutrient cycles, and ensure cultural and human well-being. The growing demand in forests products together with current global changes increases the pressure on remaining natural forests <span class="citation">(Gibson et al. 2011; Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span> and threatens the maintenance and dynamics in space and time of communities structure, composition and functioning <span class="citation">(Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In tropical forests, ecological communities are regularly re-shaped by natural disturbance events changing both the abiotic environment, through the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>, and the biotic interactions such as competition among species <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000; Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. One of the cornerstone of tropical forest ecology is to understand the processes and drivers of ecosystems response to disturbance <span class="citation">(White and Jentsch 2001; Chazdon 2003)</span>. For now, this has been largely studied through forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span> that are rapid and convenient to measure. These structural parameters have been sucessfully modeled, giving important insights into the recovery of ecosystem processes and services <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. However the response of forests diversity and composition is still unclear, albeit it determines the productivity, stability and functioning of ecosystems <span class="citation">(D. Tilman, Isbell, and Cowles 2014; Liang et al. 2016)</span>. In the short-term, moderate disturbance may lead to positive impacts on communities diversity, an idea formalized by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) stating a maximized species diversity when disturbance intensity is not too high <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Kariuki et al. 2006; Berry et al. 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>Validations of the IDH though remain scarce in the long-term and mainly rely on the analysis of taxonomic richness <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Taxonomic richness, alone, gives limited or misleading information on forests recovery and functioning <span class="citation">(Philip A. Martin et al. 2015; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. More ecological-meaningful analysis would couple richness with (i) evenness that would reveal underlying ecological processes and (ii) composition that is crucial for conservation issues <span class="citation">(Magurran 1988; Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>. Furthermore, a functional approach accounting for species biological attributes would directly link communities diversity, composition and redundancy to ecosystem functioning and to its environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Moretti et al. 2009; Baraloto et al. 2012; Scheiter, Langan, and Higgins 2013)</span>. In that respect, the functional trait-based approach that focus on major traits related to species ecology and mediate species performance in a given environment was sucessfully adopted <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005; Villéger, Mason, and Mouillot 2008)</span>. For instance, the functional approach revealed in tropical rainforests the deterministic processes entailing, after disturbance, a functional shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources to “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(TerSteege and Hammond 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into the trajectories of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf and stem traits) and life-history traits (seed mass, maximum size) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>. Eventually a complete overview of communities response to disturbance would encompass the changes in functional redundancy, that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The high functional redundancy of hyperdiverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines the resilience of communities after disturbance <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of ecosystem above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition and redundancy <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. Specifically, we (i) questioned the recovery of communities taxonomic and functional characteristics and identified the underlying assembly processes, (ii) clarified the validity of the IDH in the long term for tropical forest and elucidated its translation into different trajectories, and (iii) questioned community recovery time.</p>
