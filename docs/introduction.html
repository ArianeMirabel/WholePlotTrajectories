Understanding the ecological rules underlying the maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global change context. The huge diversity of tropical forests is often assumed to be regularly reshaped by natural disturbance yielding a diversity peak at intermediate intensity. This intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), though, remains debated and the controversy questions the extent of community resilience regarding their taxonomic and functional facets. To disentangle the ecological processes driving community response to disturbance, we analyzed the tree community trajectories over 30 years following a disturbance gradient in a Neotropical forest. Specifically, we examined community functional and taxonomic trajectories with regards to diversity, composition and redundancy. Functional trajectories were drawn based on 7 leaf, stem and life-history traits. We highlighted the cyclic recovery of community taxonomic and functional composition. While pre-disturbance taxonomic differences were maintained over time, functional composition trajectories were quite similar among communities. The IDH did predict community taxonomic diversity response while functional diversity was enhanced whatever the disturbance intensity. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years. This acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles with no disturbance to ensure a complete recovery, and questioned tropical forest community resilience after repeated disturbances.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Tropical forests cover large areas worldwide and represent crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate the local and regional climates, determine the cycles of carbon, water and nutrient, and ensure cultural and human well-being. However, the growing demand in forests products together with current global changes increases the pressure on remaining natural forests <span class="citation">(Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>. This context specifically threatens the maintenance of community structure, composition and functioning <span class="citation">(Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013)</span>. In tropical forests indeed, tree communities are shaped and maintained by a natural disturbance regime, specifically tree fall gaps<span class="citation">(Schnitzer and Carson 2001)</span>. This disturbance regime is affected by the current changing context and anthropic activities <span class="citation">(Sist et al. 2015)</span>, so clarify community responses to disturbance and the underlying ecological processes is crucial to anticipate the fate of tropical forests <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2003)</span>.</p>
<p>Disturbances change both biotic and abiotic environment, through modifications in the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>, and modifications in the interactions among species <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000)</span>. Community response has been largely studied through forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Thereafter, models based on the observed trajectories after disturbance gave important insights into community recovery and resilience <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Regarding community diversity and composition, however, post-disturbance trajectories are not as thoroughly understood. It is recognized that a determined succession, mainly driven by the recruitment of pioneer and heliophilous species, shape community post-disturbance trajectories <span class="citation">(Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012; Poorter et al. 2016)</span>. Deterministic processes would then be major processes of community response to disturbance. This would make post-disturbance trajectories deterministic, and then predictable according to the disturbance intensity and to the characteristics of the pre-disturbance community. Yet, observed trajectories in diversity and composition often deviate from predictions. Although the deterministic ecological processes at stake are identified, their interplay with stochastic processes and their relative importance remains debated <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2015)</span>. This debate translates into the validation and the extent of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). The IDH assumes the predominance of deterministic processes, and predicts a maximum species diversity after moderate disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Kariuki et al. 2006)</span>. The IDH has been scarcely validated in the long-term and often rely on the analysis of taxonomic richness <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Taxonomic richness alone, however, gives limited or misleading information on forests recovery and functioning <span class="citation">(Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. More ecological-meaningful analysis would couple richness with species evenness, which reveals the changes in the species abundance distribution, and (ii)species composition, which is crucial for conservation issues <span class="citation">(Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>. Furthermore, a functional approach accounting for species biological attributes would directly link community diversity, composition and redundancy to ecosystem functioning and to its environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. In that respect, the functional trait-based approach that focus on major traits related to species ecology and mediate species performance in a given environment was successfully adopted <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. For instance, the functional approach revealed in tropical rainforests the deterministic processes entailing, after disturbance, a functional shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources to “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into the trajectories of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf and stem traits) and life-history traits (seed mass, maximum size) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>. Eventually, a complete overview of community response to disturbance would encompass the changes in functional redundancy, that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The high functional redundancy of hyper-diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines community resilience after disturbance <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Improve the understanding of diversity and composition response to disturbance would then require to combine taxonomic and functional diversity and composition metrics that is not often provided <span class="citation">(Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012,<span class="citation">Mouillot et al. (2013)</span>)</span>. Long term monitoring provided trajectories over several decades would allow to put in perspectives the existing studies that often correspond to chronosequence studies <span class="citation">(Chazdon et al. 2007)</span> or cover 10 or 15 years after disturbance <span class="citation">(Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of ecosystem above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition and redundancy. From post-disturbance trajectories (i) we determined the taxonomic and functional translation post-disturbance succession at community scale. (ii) we validated the importance of deterministic processes in community response to disturbance. We defined th interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes along time, which allowed discussing the IDH. (iii) examined community recovery time.</p>
