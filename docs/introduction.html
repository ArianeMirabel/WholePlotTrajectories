Understanding the ecological rules underlying the maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global change context. The huge diversity of tropical forests is often assumed to be regularly reshaped by natural disturbance yielding a diversity peak at intermediate intensity. This intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), though, remains debated and the resilience of community taxonomic and functional diversity and composition remains controversial. To disentangle the ecological processes driving community response to disturbance, we analyzed tree community trajectories following a disturbance gradient in a Neotropical forest. We examined community diversity, composition and redundancy trajectories over 30 years, considering both taxonomic and functional trajectories based on 7 leaf, stem and life-history traits. We highlighted the cyclic recovery of community taxonomic and functional composition. While pre-disturbance taxonomic differences were maintained over time, functional composition trajectories were quite similar among communities. The IDH did predict community taxonomic diversity response while functional diversity was enhanced whatever the disturbance intensity. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years. This acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles with no disturbance to ensure a complete recovery, and questioned tropical forest community resilience after repeated disturbances.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, and ensure cultural and human well-being. They regulate as well the local and regional climates, and the carbon, water and nutrient cycles. However, the growing demand in forests products together with current global changes increase the pressure on remaining natural forests <span class="citation">(Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>. These threats affect the natural disturbance regime that shape and maintain the structure, composition and functioning of tree communities <span class="citation">(Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>. It is now urgent to understand the processes underlying community response to disturbance, and thus to be able to anticipate the fate of tropical forests in the current context. In tropical forests, disturbance maintains a forest environment and initiates a suit of changes in the structure and functioning of communities consituting a secondary succession. Disturbance change both community abiotic and biotic environments, through modifications in the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>. For now, post-disturbance trajectories has been largely studied through forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Models based on observed trajectories then assessed community time to recovery and identified some of the determinants of post-disturbance trajectories, like forest structure, forest composition, environmental parameters and disturbance characteristics <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Regarding community diversity and composition, however, post-disturbance trajectories have not been as thoroughly understood <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. The variety of species response to disturbance entail different processes like colonisation, facilitation, coexistence, etc, which succession shapes biodiversity post-disturbance trajectories <span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012; Garcia_Florez et al. 2017)</span>. The rate, endpoint and duration of the trajectories depend on the intensity and frequency of disturbance: a current objective of tropical ecology is to highlight the link betwenn biodiversity and disturbance and anticipate community trajectories <span class="citation">(R. L. Chazdon 2003; Willig and Presley 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>An early conceptual basis of the linkage between biodiversity and disturbance is the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). The IDH assumes a relationship between community diversity and the intensity and frequency of disturbance events <span class="citation">(Connell 1978)</span>. The theory and states that community diversity peaks at intermediate level of disturbance. The fluctuations of environmental conditions after disturbance are assumed to prevent competitive exclusion in fostering both competitively superior species and fast colonizers <span class="citation">(Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Pulsford, Lindenmayer, and Driscoll 2016)</span>. In highly diverse tropical forests, however, observations of the IDH are often blurry compared to theoretical expectations <span class="citation">(Randall Hughes et al. 2007; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Norden et al. 2017)</span>, and the validation of the theory remains controversial <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Fox 2013; Sheil and Burslem 2013)</span>. As previously highlighted, there is a variety of ecological processes emerging after disturbance, and the pattern of the IDH (the diversity peak under intermediate disturbance) can result from several such processes. Disentangle the processes involved and their succession in time would allow discussing the conditions for the application of the IDH, its scope in time, and its implication for the fate of forests <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Examine post-disturbance trajectories requires a set of diversity metrics, to grasp all aspects of community changes <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>. Specifically, diversity metrics should assess taxonomic richness, evenness and composition, in order to highlight the changes the community abundance distribution and in the species fostered by the disturbance. Analysis would as well include a functional approach accounting for species biological attributes and ecological strategy. The trait-based approach directly links community diversity, composition and redundancy to ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. In that respect, a vast literature allowed recognizing major traits that represent species ecological strategy and determine how they respond to changing conditions <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Specifically in tropical forests, the functional approach revealed the post-disturbance deterministic processes entailing a shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources, to a dominance of “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into the trajectories of average community value of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf and stem traits) and life-history strategy (seed mass, maximum size) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>. The functional approach also encompasses the analysis of functional redundancy, that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The high functional redundancy of hyper-diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines the resilience of communities after disturbance <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition and redundancy. Specifically, we (i) elucidated community taxonomic and functional resilience, (ii) discussed the scope of the IDH and the underlying ecological processes, and (iii) examined community recovery time.</p>
