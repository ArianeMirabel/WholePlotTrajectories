In the current global change context, it is urgent to anticipate the fate of tropical forests. This means understanding tree community response to disturbance and the underlying processes. In that respect, we aim here to clarify taxonomic and functional post-disturbance trajectories, and determine the scope of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) that remains debated in tropical forests. We analyzed community trajectories following a disturbance gradient from 10 to 60% of above-ground biomass loss in a Neotropical forest over 30 years. We considered trajectories along time of community taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition, and redundancy. We based on the annual botanical inventories of 75 ha of a Neotropical forest and on large trait datasets comprising seven leaf, stem, and life-history traits. We identified a decoupling between taxonomic composition, differing among communities, and functional composition,  similar among communities and convergent in the functional space.  The taxonomic diversity followed humped-shaped trajectories along time after disturbance depending on the initial disturbance intensity, which validated the IDH (Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis). The functional diversity trajectories,however, were homogeneous among plots and dismissed the IDH. We explained this decoupling by the variations in community functional redundancy that mitigated the functional impact of disturbance. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity, and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years.  These results acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles without disturbance to ensure community complete recovery.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic, and social values.
They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, and ensure cultural and human well-being.
They regulate local and regional climates, as well as carbon, water and nutrient cycles.
However, the growing demand in forests products together with current global changes increase the pressure on remaining undisturbed forests <span class="citation">(Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>.
These threats may change the frequency and magnitude of the natural disturbance regime that defines and maintains the structure, composition, and functioning of tree communities <span class="citation">(Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>. 
To anticipate the fate of tropical forests, it is urgent to understand tree community response to disturbance, and the underlying ecological processes.
The forest cover is generally maintained following disturbance, but modifications in the fluxes of light, heat, and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span> change community abiotic and biotic environments.
These changes translate into post-disturbance community trajectories that have been largely studied through trajectories of forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>.
Some of the determinants of post-disturbance biomass trajectories are already identified, like the structure and composition of the pre-disturbance community, or the post-disturbance environmental parameters <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>.
Community diversity and composition trajectories, however, have not been as thoroughly understood <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018; Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>, and manifold biodiversity trajectories might emerge given the variety of species response to disturbance and the diversity of tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012; Garcia Florez et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>An early conceptual basis of the linkage between biodiversity and disturbance is the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH).
The IDH states a relationship between the community diversity and the intensity and frequency of disturbance events, and postulates a diversity peak at intermediate level of disturbance <span class="citation">(Connell 1978)</span>.
This is based on the fluctuations of community environment following disturbance that foster both competitively superior species and fast colonizers, and prevents competitive exclusion <span class="citation">(Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Pulsford, Lindenmayer, and Driscoll 2016)</span>.

In tropical forests, some studies advocate community deterministic response to disturbance, as for example in the dry and wet forests in Ghana <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span> or in the guianese rainforests <span class="citation">(Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>, where intermediate disturbance proved to increase the community richness by increasing the proportion of pioneers or heliophilous species in the community while maintaining the richness in old-growth forest species. In other cases, however, observations of the IDH diverge from theoretical expectations <span class="citation">(Randall Hughes et al. 2007; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Norden et al. 2017)</span>. Some studies refute the role of disturbance intensity, as observed in forest gaps in Panama where no difference in species richness was found between forest gaps and undisturbed areas <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001)</span>, or in costa-rican forests where forests that did not follow deterministic convergence display stochastic trajectories <span class="citation">(Norden et al. 2015)</span>.<br />
The high diversity of tropical forests may foster the emergence of numerous facilitation, adaptation, and inter- and intra-specific competition following disturbance <span class="citation">(Garcia Florez et al. 2017; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>.These interactions can result in miscellaneous responses to disturbance <span class="citation">(Lindenmayer, Burton, and Franklin 2012)</span>, which question the validity of the IDH in tropical forests <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; Fox 2013; Sheil and Burslem 2013)</span>.
</p>
<p>Analysing community response to disturbance and grasp all aspects of community changes requires a wide array of metrics <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003; Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>.
The analysis should first consider community composition, which is crucial for conservation issues and reveals the pool of species fostered or hampered by disturbance <span class="citation">(Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>.
This should be completed with diversity metrics encompassing both community richness and evenness to assess the changes in community abundance distribution.
Besides, functional approaches have been shown to usefully complement pure taxonomic approaches as they shed light on the species biological attributes directly linking community diversity, composition, and redundancy to ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>.
In that respect, a vast literature allowed recognizing major traits representing species ecological strategy and determining how they respond to changing conditions <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.
Specifically, in tropical forests, the functional approach revealed the emergence of deterministic processes following disturbance.
Such deterministic processes entailed a shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources, to a dominance of “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>.
This shift is translated into the trajectories of average community value of key functional traits related to resource acquisition, as leaf and stem traits, and life-history strategy, as seed mass and maximum size <span class="citation">(Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The functional approach also encompasses the analysis of functional redundancy, that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>.
The typical high functional redundancy of hyper-diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning, and determines community resilience after disturbance <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem, and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition, and redundancy.
Specifically, (i) we drew taxonomic and functional post-disturbance trajectories and examined the underlying ecological processes, (ii) we discussed the scope of the IDH regarding taxonomic and functional facets of community diversity, and (iii) we analyzed community resilience and time to recovery.

We hypothesized that community functional and taxonomic trajectories might not track each other, given the high functional redundancy in tropical forests. While functional diversity would be enhanced by the environmental changes following disturbance, specifically the increase in light availability, taxonomic trajectories would only increase until a disturbance intensity threshold, as pioneers recruited following disturbance are not as diverse as late-successional species. Community taxonomic and functional would hence follow different rates of recovery.
