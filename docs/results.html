<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.0.1</span> Taxonomic and functional composition</h3>
<p><em>Composition trajectories</em> _ Trajectories of taxonomic and functional composition after disturbance were examined through the ordination of successive inventories from 1989 (5 years after disturbance) in a two-dimensional space based on NMDS analysis. Classifications were based on either abundance-based Bray-Curtis  or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity (data not shown).</p>
<p>Both taxonomic and functional composition were substantially affected by disturbance and positively correlated with its intensity. <em>The distance from the initial condition was significantly time-dependent (P&lt;0.01).</em> The taxonomic composition remained significantly different from the 1989 reference inventory until 30 years for all disturbed plots . From 20 years after disturbance, though, the distancing decreased which suggested a return toward the reference 1989 inventory and its resilience to disturbance ,. The functional composition distancing from the reference inventory was also positively correlated with disturbance intensity and similarly stabilized or reduced (for 5 of T1, T2 and T3 plots) from 20 years after disturbance . <em>The coordinates of the functional traits were measured in the two-dimensional ordination space that mapped plots evolution along time (graphs not showed) which revealed that the trajectories of disturbed plots along time headed toward acquisitive functional strategies (from high SWG to high SLA and chlorophyll content).</em></p>

<p><em>Taxonomic diversity</em> _ Trajectories of Richness, Shannon and Simpson taxonomic diversity were examined in relation to the 1994 inventories . <em>For the three indices the OLS regression confirmed the time-dependency of the diversity variations (P&lt;0.01) and a covariance analysis confirmed the significant effect of the disturbance treatment (P&lt;0.01).</em></p>

<p>The evolution along time of the difference of Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity compared to reference inventories in 1989 remained even for 30 years after disturbance for the control plots whereas disturbed plots showed significant increase, positively correlated with the disturbance intensity . The richness stabilized for all disturbed plots from 20 years after disturbance . The Shannon and Simpson diversity also stabilized 20 years after disturbance for T1 and T2 plots  whereas for 2 out of 3 plots T3 the Shannon and Simpson diversity continued increasing until 30 years after disturbance, illustrating a significant increase in communities’ evenness.</p>
<p><em>Functional diversity</em> _ The evolution along time of the Rao functinal diversity compared to reference inventories in 1989 remained even all along the survey for the control plots. All disturbed plots however showed an increase of the functional diversity that was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity . 30 after disturbance the diversity of disturbed plots remained significantly higher than this of control plots, thus whenever the initial disturbance intensity. The slope of the initial diversity increase and the maximum diversity were both positively correlated with the disturbance intensity. <em>The OLS regression confirmed the time-dependency of the diversity variations (P&lt;0.01) and the covariance analysis confirmed the significant effect of the disturbance treatment (P&lt;0.01)</em>. The trajectories of plot 7 from the T1 disturbance treatment was discarded because of too high taxonomic uncertainty preventing correct analysis.</p>
