<p>Over time, 828388 trees and 591 botanical species pertaining to 223 genus and 64 botanical families were recorded. Taxonomic and functional plots trajectories were examined through the trajecotries in a two dimensional ordination space of successive inventories from 1989 (5 years after disturbance) to 2015 (31 years after disturbance). Classifications were performed using either abundance-based Bray-Curtis (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>) or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity, this last having given similar results (data not shown).</p>
<p>Both taxonomic and functional composition of disturbed plots followed consistent trajectories over time, translating compositional changes while control plots remained stable. The addition of functional traits in the two dimensional space revealed a shift of plots composition towards more acquisitive functional strategies (disturbed plots changed from high average WD to high average SLA and chlorophyll content). The dissimilarity of the successive inventories for disturbed plots compared to their respective reference inventory in 1989 followed unimodal trajectories (AppendixI, Figure A2). The maximum dissimilarity of plot strajectories was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity for taxonomic (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.91\)</span>) as well as functional composition (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.96\)</span>). The time at maximum dissimilarity for taxonomic composition was reached around 26 years after disturbance while it was 22 years for functional composition. All trajectories returned towards the initial composition and translated cyclic compositional changes as visualized in figure (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>).</p>

<p>The changes observed in plots functional composition went hand to hand with consistent trajectories of the 8 functional and life history traits visualized through plots community weighted means (CWM) (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>) of the leaves thickness, chlorophyll content, toughness and specific area, wood specific gravity, bark thickness, seed mass and maximum adult height.</p>
<p>Except for leaf cholorphyll content, which continued to increase for some T3 and T2 plots 30 years after disturbance, all traits and seed mass proportions displayed a unimodal trajectories. The weighted means of communities specific maximum height at adult stage (<em>Hmax</em>), leaf toughness (<em>L_toughness</em>) and wood specific gravity (<em>WD</em>) remained significantly lower than their initial value and than these of the control plots (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>). The weighted means of bark thickness (<em>Bark_thick</em>) similarly remained substantilly higher than initially for all disturbed plots while the specfic leaf area (<em>SLA</em>) had almost recovered its initial value and this of the undisturbed plots at the end of the experiment. Once again the maximum difference to initial state was correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{thickness}}=0.67\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{chloro}}=0.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{toughness}}=-0.43\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{SLA}=0.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{WD}=-0.78\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Bark-thickness}=0.88\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Hmax}=-0.48\)</span>).</p>

<p>For undisturbed plots the Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversities remained stable over the 30 years monitored. After low disturbance intensity the richness increased, reaching a maximum gain of 14 botanical genera (plot 3 from treatment 2). After intense disturbance however, the taxonomic richness followed a unimodal decrease with a return to pre-disturbance values. The taxonomic evenness (Shannon and Simpson diversities) increased after disturbance, whenever its intensity. The evenness followed a unimodal trajectory with a just beginning return towards initial values and a maximum value, reached around 20 years, positively correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Shannon}=0.86\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Simpson}=0.89\)</span>). Only two T3 plots (plots 8 and 12) were still increasing 30 years after disturbance <a href="results.html#fig:DivTaxo">3.3</a>), suggesting a similar be much delayed unimodal trajectory.</p>
<p>Communities functional diversity trajectories were examined through the Rao diversity based on the 7 leaf, stem and life history traits (the seed mass was excluded as a qualitative variable). The plot 7 from treatment 1 that displayed a constantly outlying diversity was removed from the graphical representation for better readability, see figure A3 in appendix for full graph. The functional diversity of all undisturbed communities remained stable along the 30 years monitored. For all disturbed communities the functional diversity followed unimodal trajectories with a marked return towards the initial state (5 years after disturbance) with values comparable to those of control plots.</p>
<p>The impact of disturbance was examined specifically at 10, 20 and 30 years after disturbance through the linear correlation between the initial percentage of AGB removed and the value of communities Simpson and Rao diversities (both diversities of order 2).</p>

<p>The functional redundancy was measured as the sum of weighted overlap among species in communities’ functional space. Functional space were defined in the main two-dimensional space of a PCA analysis based on all leaf and stem and maximum height traits (see appendix I for PCA details). Plots functional redundancy compared to the initial value after logging so that only communities dynamics are followed apart from the impact of logging itself. Communities functional redundancy remained stable in control plots but after disturbance the redundancy trajectories were quite variable (See appendix I). Globally after most intense disturbance (plots T2 and T3) communities redundancy decreased at first place and then increased to edge, recover or even exceed the initial value. Considering the functional redundancy restricted to the functional space of the initial inventory, though, all disturbed plots followed similar decreasing humped-shaped trajectories (@ref(fig:RedFun_rest)). The maximum redundancy loss observed was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity (XX spearman to be measured) and none of the disturbed plots had recovered the functional redundancy within their initial functional space.</p>
