<p><em>Composition trajectories</em></p>
<p>Over time, 828388 trees and 591 botanical species pertaining to 223 genus and 64 botanical families were recorded. Trajectories of taxonomic and functional composition after disturbance were examined through the ordination of successive inventories from 1989 (5 years after disturbance) in the two-dimensional space from NMDS analysis based on flora inventories and the corresponding functional composition. Classifications were performed using either abundance-based Bray-Curtis <a href="results.html#fig:Fig1">3.1</a> or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity (data not shown).</p>
<p>Both taxonomic and functional composition were substantially affected by disturbance, and the maximum dissimilarity to 1984 reference inventory composition was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity. Until 30 years after disturbance, all disturbed plots taxonomic composition remained significantly dissimilar to that of the 1989 reference inventory composition <a href="results.html#fig:Fig1">3.1</a>. All plots, though, displayed a unimodal trajectory with a the return toward the taxonomic and functional composition of the 1989 reference inventory suggesting a shift towards a cyclic regime <a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>. For taxonomic composition, the maximum dissimilarity to 1984 inventory composition was reach around 20 years after disturbance for the T2 and T3 plots and for one T1 plot while control and other T1 plots continued to increase @ref(fig:Fig2.a). For functional composition, the maximum dissimilarity to 1984 inventory composition was reach from 15 to 20 years after disturbance for the T2 and T3 plots while T1 and control plots continued to increase @ref(fig:Fig2.b). The functional composition distancing from the reference inventory was also positively correlated with disturbance intensity and similarly stabilized or reduced (for 5 of T1, T2 and T3 plots) from 20 years after disturbance <a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a>.</p>
<p><em>The distance from the initial condition was significantly time-dependent (P&lt;0.01).</em> <em>The coordinates of the functional traits were measured in the two-dimensional ordination space that mapped plots evolution along time (graphs not showed) which revealed that the trajectories of disturbed plots along time headed toward acquisitive functional strategies (from high SWG to high SLA and chlorophyll content).</em></p>

<p><em>Traits community weighted means</em></p>
<p>For all plots the trajectories of the community weighted means (CWM) were drawn for the 8 functional and life history traits (Leaf thickness, chlorophyll content, toughness and specific area,wood specific gravity and barck thickness and seed mass and maximum adult height) <a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To compensate the intrinsinc difference among plots the trajectories drawn correspond to the difference in value between the reference inventory in &gt;1984 (5 year after disturbance) and the successive years inventoried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except for leaves cholorphyll content, which displayed higher difference between plots than among treatments which may be due to the completeness of dataset, all CWM trajectories corresponded to significant changes after disturbance. All functional traits and seed mass proportions displayed a unimodal trajectories but with different times at maximum and different values at the end of the experiment (30 years after disturbance). 30 years after disturbance, the weighted means of communities specific maximum height at adult stage (<em>Hmax</em>), leaf toughness (<em>L_toughness</em>) and wood specific gravity (<em>WD</em>) remained significantly lower than their initial value and than these of the control plots <a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>. The weighted means of bark thickness (<em>Bark_thick</em>) similarly remained substantilly higher than initially for all disturbed plots while the specfic leaf area (<em>SLA</em>) had almost recovered its initial value and this of the undisturbed plots at the end of the experiment.</p>

<p>While for undisturbed plots the Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity remained comparable to the values in 1989, the trajectories of all disturbed plots showed significant increase positively correlated with the disturbance intensity <a href="results.html#fig:Fig5">3.5</a>. The Richness was less affected by the initial disturbance except for the higher intensity (T3 plots) <a href="results.html#fig:Fig5">3.5</a>. The Shannon and Simpson diversities however first significantly increased, illustrating an increasing evenness, before reaching a maximum around 15 years after disturbance for all plots except one from T1 treatment and one from T2 treatment <a href="results.html#fig:Fig5">3.5</a> .</p>

<p>For all undisturbed plots the Rao diversity remained comparable to the values in 1989, the trajectories of all disturbed plots showed significant increase positively correlated with the disturbance intensity <a href="results.html#fig:Fig6">3.6</a>.
