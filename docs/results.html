<p>Over time, 828388 trees and 591 botanical species pertaining to 223 genus and 64 botanical families were recorded. Taxonomic and functional plots trajectories were examined through the trajecotries in a two dimensional ordination space of successive inventories from 1989 (5 years after disturbance) to 2015 (31 years after disturbance). Classifications were performed using either abundance-based Bray-Curtis (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>) or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity, this last having given similar results (data not shown).</p>
<p>Both taxonomic and functional composition of disturbed plots followed consistent trajectories over time, translating compositional changes while control plots remained stable. The addition of functional traits in the two dimensional space revealed a shift of plots composition towards more acquisitive functional strategies (disturbed plots changed from high average WD to high average SLA and chlorophyll content). The dissimilarity of the successive inventories for disturbed plots compared to their respective reference inventory in 1989 followed unimodal trajectories (AppendixI, Figure A2). The maximum dissimilarity of plot strajectories was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity for taxonomic (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.91\)</span>) as well as functional composition (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.96\)</span>). The time at maximum dissimilarity for taxonomic composition was reached around 26 years after disturbance while it was 22 years for functional composition. All trajectories returned towards the initial composition and translated cyclic compositional changes as visualized in figure (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>).</p>

<p>The changes observed in plots functional composition went hand to hand with consistent trajectories of the 8 functional and life history traits (Leaf thickness, chlorophyll content, toughness and specific area, wood specific gravity and bark thickness and seed mass and maximum adult height) visualized with plots community weighted means (CWM) (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>).</p>
<p>Except for leaf cholorphyll content, which continued to increase for some T3 and T2 plots 30 years after disturbance, all traits and seed mass proportions displayed a unimodal trajectories. The weighted means of communities specific maximum height at adult stage (<em>Hmax</em>), leaf toughness (<em>L_toughness</em>) and wood specific gravity (<em>WD</em>) remained significantly lower than their initial value and than these of the control plots (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.2</a>). The weighted means of bark thickness (<em>Bark_thick</em>) similarly remained substantilly higher than initially for all disturbed plots while the specfic leaf area (<em>SLA</em>) had almost recovered its initial value and this of the undisturbed plots at the end of the experiment. Once again the maximum difference to initial state was correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{thickness}}=0.67\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{chloro}}=0.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{toughness}}=-0.43\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{SLA}=0.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{WD}=-0.78\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Bark-thickness}=0.88\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Hmax}=-0.48\)</span>).</p>

<p>For undisturbed plots the Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversities remained stable over the 30 monitored years. After disturbance the richness increased when the disturbance intensity was low, with a maximum increase of 14 botanical genera (plot 3 from treatment 2). When the disturbance was intense however, plots taxonomic richness followed a unimodal decrease with a return to initial values after intense disturbance. The taxonomic evenness (Shannon and Simpson diversities) significantly increased irrespective of the disturbance intensity. The evenness followed a unimodal trajectory with a just beginning return towards initial values and a maximum reached around 20 years and positively correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Shannon}=0.86\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Simpson}=0.89\)</span>). Only two T3 plots, plots 8 and 12, remained increasing 30 years after disturbance <a href="results.html#fig:DivTaxo">3.3</a>), suggesting a similar be much delayed unimodal trajectory.</p>

<p>The functional diversity trajectories of plots based on the 8 leaf, stem and life history traits was examined through the Rao diversity. For all undisturbed plots the functional diversity remained comparable to the reference values 5 years after disturbance (1989 inventories). For all disturbed plots the functional trajectories followed a unimodal trajectory with a maximum positively correlated to disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}=0.73\)</span>) (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:DivFun">3.4</a>). The plot 7 from treatment 1 that displayed a constantly outlying diversity was removed from the graphical representation for better readability, see appendix for full graph. Thirty years after disturbance all plots, whenever the initial disturbance intensity, regained diversity values similar to their initial value and to those of control plots.</p>
