<p>In the inventories from 1989 (5 years after disturbance) to 2015 (31 years after disturbance), 828388 trees and 591 botanical species pertaining to 223 genus and 64 botanical families were recorded. Communities taxonomic diversity trajectories were examined through the Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversities at genus level, in relation to the 1989 inventories (5 years after disturbance) (See annexe I). For undisturbed plots the Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversities remained stable over the 30 years monitored. In disturbed communities the taxonomic richness increased after low disturbance intensity, reaching a maximum gain of 14 botanical genera (plot 3 from treatment 2) while it followed unimodal trajectories after intense disturbance, decreasing for ten years before recovering pre-disturbance values. In all disturbed plots the taxonomic evenness (Shannon and Simpson diversities) increased, following unimodal trajectories with a maximum, reached after around 20 years, positively correlated to the disturbance treatment (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Shannon}=0.86\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Simpson}=0.89\)</span>). Return towards initial evenness values was beginning after 30 years except for two T3 plots (plots 8 and 12) which evenness still increased, suggesting similar but delayed trajectories <a href="results.html#fig:IDHplot">3.1</a>.</p>
<p>Trajectories of communities functional diversity were examined through the Rao diversity based on the 7 leaf, stem and life history traits (to the exception of seed mass). The plot 7 from treatment 1 displayed a constantly outlying diversity and was removed from the graphical representation for better readability (see appendix for full graphs). In undisturbed plots the functional diversity remained stable along the 30 years while in disturbed plots it followed unimodal trajectories with a return towards initial values that strated around 20 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>The impact of disturbance was examined specifically through the linear correlation between the intial %AGB removed and the Simpson and Rao diversities (diversities of order 2) after 10, 20 and 30 years <a href="results.html#fig:IDHplot">3.1</a>. The correlation with disturbance intensity was weak for the Simpson diversity (<span class="math inline">\(R^2&lt;0.25\)</span>) and only valid from 20 years after disturbance but it was much stronger for the Rao diversity (<span class="math inline">\(0.60&lt;R^2&lt;0.75\)</span>) for all the time studied. Slope of linear correlations, reflecting the impact of disturbance, was the highest 20 years after disturbance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Taxonomic and functional trajectories</h3>
<p>The trajectories of taxonomic and functional composition were visualized in a two dimensional ordination space mapping the successive inventories according to their flora and corresponding traits. Classifications were performed using either abundance-based Bray-Curtis (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.2</a>) or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity, both giving similar results only analysis using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity are discussed.</p>
<p>While both taxonomic and functional composition remained stable in undistrubed communities, they followed consistent trajectories over time after disturbance which revealed significant compositional changes. According to the mapping of functional traits (see appendix I) these compositional changes corresponded to shifts towards species with more acquisitive functional strategies, from communities with high average WD to high average SLA and chlorophyll content. For disturbed communities the distance of successive inventories to the 1989 reference inventory followed unimodal trajectories translating cyclic compositional changes with a recovery of the initial composition (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.2</a>). The maximum dissimilarity with the initial state was positively correlated to the disturbance treatment for both taxonomic and functional composition (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.91\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{functional}=0.96\)</span> respectively) and the time at maximum was reached around 26 years after disturbance for taxonomic composition and 22 years for functional composition.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Traits community weighted means (CWM)</h3>
<p>The changes observed in plots functional composition went hand to hand with consistent trajectories of the 8 functional and life history traits visualized with the trajectories of community weighted means (CWM) of leaves economics (leaves thickness, chlorophyll content, toughness and specific area), wood economics (wood specific gravity, bark thickness), and life history traits (seed mass and maximum adult height) (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.3</a>).</p>
<p>Except for leaf chlorophyll content, which continued to increase for some T3 and T2 plots 30 years after disturbance, all traits and seed mass proportions followed unimodal trajectories either stabilizing or returning towards their initial values. Thirty years after disturbance the weighted means of communities specific maximum height at adult stage (<em>Hmax</em>), leaf toughness (<em>L_toughness</em>) and wood specific gravity (<em>WD</em>) remained significantly lower than their initial value (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.3</a>). The weighted means of bark thickness (<em>Bark_thick</em>) similarly remained substantially higher than initially for all disturbed plots while the specfic leaf area (<em>SLA</em>) had almost recovered its initial value. For all traits the maximum difference to initial state was correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{thickness}}=0.67\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{chloro}}=0.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{toughness}}=-0.43\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{SLA}=0.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{WD}=-0.78\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Bark-thickness}=0.88\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Hmax}=-0.48\)</span>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Functional redundancy</h3>
<p>Communities functional redundancy was measured as the sum within communities the species weighted functional overlap based on the 7 leaf, stem, and maximum height traits (see appendix I for PCA details). Communities functional redundancy remained stable in control plots but after disturbance the redundancy trajectories were quite variable (See appendix I) and apparently independently of the initial disturbance. Globally after most intense disturbance (plots T2 and T3) communities redundancy decreased at first place before increasing to edge, recover or exceed the initial value.</p>
<p>Considering the functional redundancy restricted to the functional space of the initial inventory, all disturbed plots followed similar decreasing humped-shaped trajectories (@ref(fig:RedFun_rest)). The maximum redundancy loss was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity (XX spearman to be measured) and the initial value had not recovered for any disturbed communities.</p>
