<p>From 1984, the first pre-disturbance inventory, to 2015, 28 years after disturbance, 828 388 individual trees and 591 botanical species spanning 223 genera and 64 families were recorded.</p>
<p>In undisturbed plots, both taxonomic and functional composition remained stable (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>). In disturbed plots, both trajectories followed marked and consistent trajectories over time.</p>
<p>The functional composition trajectory resembled, in disturbed communities, to cyclic compositional changes with an incomplete recovery of the initial composition (Fig.). The maximum dissimilarity with the initial state was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity for both taxonomic and functional composition (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Taxonomic}=0.94\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Functional}=0.90\)</span>, respectively. Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:SumUp">3.6</a>). The maximum dissimilarity with the initial state was reached for taxonomic composition between 15 to 25 years, and between 20 to 25 years for functional composition.</p>

<p>In control plots, Community Weighted Means (CWM) of functional traits remained stable in time.<br />
In disturbed plots, they mostly followed unimodal trajectories, either stabilizing or returning towards their initial values, to the exception of leaf chlorophyll content, which continued to increase 30 years after disturbance for 4 out of 6 highly disturbed plots. Main tendencies for disturbed plots were a decrease followed by a slight increase of maximum height at adult stage (<em>Hmax</em>), leaf toughness, and wood specific gravity (<em>WSG</em>), but trait values remained significantly lower than their initial value (Fig. ).  Bark thickness and specific leaf area (<em>SLA</em>) both increased along time. Bark thickness remained substantially high after 30 years, and <em>SLA</em> had almost recovered to its initial value. Whatever the functional traits, the maximum difference to initial value was highly correlated to the disturbance intensity. Positive correlations were observed for leaf thickness, chlorophyll content, SLA and bark thickness (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Leaf thickness}=0.79\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Chlorophyll content}=0.61\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{SLA}=0.99\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Bark thickness}=0.68\)</span>). Maxima were observed between 5 and 15 years following disturbance for leaf thickness and SLA while chlorophyll content and bark thickness kept increasing after 30 years for leaf chlorophyll content and bark thickness. Negative correlation was observed for leaf toughness, WSG, and Hmax (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Leaf toughness}=-0.47\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{WSG}=-0.80\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Hmax}=-0.28\)</span>). Minima were observed between 5 and 15 years following disturbance for Hmax, 10 and 20 years for WSG, and between 15 and 25 years following disturbance for leaf toughness. The proportions of the three lightest seed mass classes increased in all disturbed plots. After 30 years the proportion of lightest seed mass class decreased while it stabilized for the two other lightest seed mass classes (Supp. Mat. - Fig. S3).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Community taxonomic and functional diversity</h2>
<p>Taxonomic richness and evenness remained stable in control plots over the 30 years of monitoring. In disturbed communities, after low disturbance intensity the taxonomic richness increased, reaching a maximum gain of 14 botanical genera. After intense disturbance the taxonomic richness followed a more complex trajectory, decreasing for ten years after disturbance before recovering to pre-disturbance values. The maximum rate of change compared to initial richness was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Richness}=0.73\)</span>).</p>
<p>In all disturbed plots , to the exception of plots 5 (T2) and 12 (T3) that showed a small initial drop,  the evenness first increased until a maximum reached after around 20 years. This maximum was positively correlated with the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Evenness}=0.82\)</span>,  Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:SumUp">3.6</a>). The evenness then stabilized except for two intensively-disturbed plots (number 8 and 12) for which it kept increasing (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:DivTaxo">3.3</a>).</p>

<p>Functional richness and evenness remained stable in control plots over the 30 years of monitoring. In disturbed communities, both functional richness and evenness trajectories increased following disturbance, with maxima positively correlated to %AGB loss <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Richness} = 0.76\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{Spearman}^{Evenness} = 0.60\)</span> (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:SumUp">3.6</a>).  For low and intermediate disturbance intensity, functional richness and evenness displayed a low but long-lasting increase up to a maximum reached after 20-25 years. For high disturbance intensity, they generally displayed a fast but short increase followed, after 10 years, by a slow decrease towards the initial values.</p>
<p>The second-degree polynomial regressions between (i) the percentage AGB loss, and (ii) the taxonomic and functional diversity showed various shapes depending on the diversity indices and on the time since disturbance (Fig. ). Regarding taxonomic diversity, the taxonomic richness showed a humped-shaped trajectory with the disturbance intensity, and peaked at 20% of initial AGB loss. The relationship between disturbance intensity and taxonomic evenness, however, was humped-shaped only 20 years after disturbance and linear for 10 and 30 years after disturbance times. Regarding functional diversity,  the relationship was linear for both taxonomic richness and evenness, except for the functional diversity after 30 years. </p>

<p>Control plots displayed stable functional redundancy over time. All disturbed plots had lower functional redundancy than control plots and followed similar humped-shaped trajectories (Fig. ).
