<p>From 1989 (2 years after disturbance) to 2015 (28 years after disturbance), 828388 individual trees and 591 botanical species pertaining to 223 genus and 64 families were recorded. For undisturbed plots, taxonomic Richness and Evenness remained stable over the 30 years monitored. In disturbed communities, after low disturbance intensity the taxonomic richness increased, reaching a maximum gain of 14 botanical genera (plot 3 from treatment 2). After intense disturbance the taxonomic richness followed a more complex trajectory, decreasing for ten years after disturbance before recovering to pre-disturbance values. In all disturbed plots the taxonomic evenness first increased until a maximum reached after around 20 years. This maximum was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Shannon}=0.86\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Simpson}=0.89\)</span>). The evenness then stabilized except for two T3 plots (plots 8 and 12) for which evenness still increased.</p>

<p>The plot 7 from treatment 1 displayed a constantly outlying functional diversity and was removed from the graphical representation for better readability (see appendix for full graphs). In undisturbed plots the functional diversity remained stable along the 30 years. In disturbed plots, trajectories depend on the disturbnace intensity with, for low intensity, a low but long-lasting increase up to amximum reached after 20-25 years and, for, high intensity, a fast but short increase followed, after 10 years, by a slow decrease towards the inital values.</p>
<p>The impact of disturbance intensity was examined through the linear correlation between (i) the %AGB removed and (ii) taxonomic richness, evenness and functional diversity after 10, 20 and 30 years <a href="results.html#fig:IDHplot">3.2</a>. The correlation with disturbance intensity was weak for te taxonomic richness (<span class="math inline">\(-0.09&lt;R^2&lt;-0.06\)</span>), for the taxonomic evenness (<span class="math inline">\(R^2&lt;0.25\)</span>) while highly significant for functional diversity (<span class="math inline">\(0.60&lt;R^2&lt;0.75\)</span>) whatever the time since disturbance.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Communities Composition</h2>
<p>While both taxonomic and functional composition remained stable in undisturbed communities (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.3</a>), they followed marked and consistent trajectories over post-disturbance time. in disturbed communities, these compositional changes corresponded to shifts towards species with more acquisitive functional strategies, from communities with high average WD to high average SLA and chlorophyll content (see appendix I). For functional composition, this translated into cyclic compositional changes with an unachieved recovery of the initial composition (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.3</a>). The maximum dissimilarity with the initial state was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity for both taxonomic and functional composition (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.91\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{functional}=0.96\)</span> respectively). The maximum value was reached around 26 years after disturbance for taxonomic composition and 22 years for functional composition.</p>

<p>Except for leaf chlorophyll content, which continued to increase for some T3 and T2 plots 30 years after disturbance, all traits and seed mass proportions followed unimodal trajectories either stabilizing or returning towards their initial values.</p>
<p>Maximum height at adult stage (<em>Hmax</em>), leaf toughness (<em>L_toughness</em>) and wood density (<em>WD</em>) first decreased and then slightly increased but remained significantly lower than their initial value (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:CWM">3.4</a>). On the other side, Bark thickness (<em>Bark_thick</em>) and specific leaf area (<em>SLA</em>) increased and while <em>Bark_thick</em> remained substantially high after 30 years, <em>SLA</em> had almost recovered its initial value. For all traits, the maximum difference to initial value was correlated to the disturbance intensity (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{thickness}}=0.67\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{chloro}}=0.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{toughness}}=-0.43\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{SLA}=0.93\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{WD}=-0.78\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Bark-thickness}=0.88\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{spearman}^{Hmax}=-0.48\)</span>).</p>
