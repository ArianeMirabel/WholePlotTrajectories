<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study site</h2>
<p>Paracou station in French Guiana (518’N and 5253’W) is located in a lowland tropical rain forest in a tropical wet climate with mean annual temperature of 26C, mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y<sup>-1</sup> (30-y period) and a 3-month dry season (&lt; 100 mm.month<sup>-1</sup>) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>. Elevation ranges between 5 and 50 m and soils correspond to thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability which produces lateral drainage during heavy rains.</p>
<p>The experiment is a network of 12 6.25 ha plots that underwent a disturbance gradient of three logging, thinning and fuelwood cutting treatments (Table <a href="#tab:Tab1"><strong>??</strong></a>) according to a randomized plot design with three replicate blocks of four plots. The disturbance corresponds to an intensity gradient. For treatment 1 (T1) 10 trees of commercial species (of a diameter at 1.3 m height (DBH) equal or above 50 cm) were felled per hectare. For treatment 2 (T2) 10 trees/ha of commercial species (DBH <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 50 cm) were felled and 30 trees/ha of non-valuable species (DBH <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 40 cm) were removed by poison girdling. For treatment 3 (T3) 10 trees/ha of commercial species (DBH <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 50 cm) were felled and 30 trees/ha of non-valuable species (15 with DBH <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 50 cm and 15 with DBH <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 40 cm) were removed by poison girdling <span class="citation">(Schmitt and Bariteau 1989)</span>. Disturbance intensity was measured as the percentage of aboveground biomass (%AGB) lost between the first inventory in 1984 and five years after disturbance <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016)</span> estimated with the BIOMASS R package <span class="citation">(Réjou-Méchain et al. 2018)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories protocol and dataset collection</h2>
<p>The study site corresponds to a tropical rainforest typical of the Guiana Shield with a dominance of <em>Fabaceae</em>, <em>Chrysobalanaceae</em>, <em>Lecythidaceae</em> and <em>Sapotaceae</em>. In the 12 experimental plots, all trees above 10 cm DBH have been mapped and measured annually since 1984. Trees are first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the forest worker team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by botanists during regular botanical campaigns. In 1984, specific vernacular names were given to 62 commercial or common species whereas more infrequent ones were identified under general identifiers only distinguishing trees and palms. From 2003, botanical campaigns have been conducted every 5 to 6 years to identify all trees at the species level but identification levels still varied among plots and campaigns.</p>
<p>This variability of protocols in time raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species. This resulted in significant taxonomic uncertainty that had to be propagated to composition and diversity metrics. The uncertainty propagation was done through a Bayesian framework reconstituting complete inventories at genus level from real incomplete ones on the basis of vernacular/botanical names association. Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials based on the association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_V\big]\)</span> observed across all inventories between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and all species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big]\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_V\big]\Big) \nonumber
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>See Supplementary Materials -Fig. S1 and <span class="citation">Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology.</p>
<p>Six functional traits representing leaf economics (leaf thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area) and stem economics (wood specific gravity and bark thickness), and life-history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass) came from the BRIDGE project.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou, and comprised 294 species pertaining to 157 genera. Missing trait values (10%) were filled using multivariate imputation by chained equation <span class="citation">(van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)</span>. Imputations were restricted within genus or family when samples were too scarce, in order to account for the phylogenetic signal. Whenever a species was not in the dataset, it was attributed a set of trait values randomly sampled among species of the next higher taxonomic level (same genus or family). As seed mass information was classified into classes, no data filling process was applied and analyses were restricted to the 414 botanical species recorded.</p>
<p>All composition and diversity metrics were obtained after 50 iterations of the uncertainty propagation framework.</p>

<div id="composition-and-diversity-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Composition and diversity metrics</h2>
<p>Because of the variability in the precision of botanical identification efforts, we were constraint to conduct the taxonomic composition and diversity analysis at the genus level. Taxonomic and functional trajectories of community composition were followed in a two-dimensional NMDS ordination plan. Two NMDS using abundance-based (Bray-Curtis) dissimilarity measures were conducted to map either taxonomic or functional composition, the latter based on the seven leaf, stem and life history traits (without seed mass classes). Trajectories along time were reported through the Euclidean distance between the target inventories and the reference inventories in 1989, <em>i.e.</em> 2 years after disturbance. Univariate trajectories of the leaf, stem and life-history traits were also visualized with the community weighted means (CWM) <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2007)</span>. Species seed mass were given in 5 mass classes. Seed mass trajectories were therefore reported as the proportion of each class in the inventories (Supplementary materials).</p>
<p>The taxonomic diversity was reported through species richness and the Hill number translation of the Simpson index <span class="citation">(Hill 1973)</span>. These metrics allowed assessing the taxonomic richness as well as evenness, through the comparison between richness and Simpson diversity. R.esults will thus be discussed directly in terms of taxonomic richness and evenness. Both indices belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0 and 2 order of diversity (q), recommended for diversity studies <span class="citation">(Marcon 2015)</span>. The functional diversity was reported using the functional richness and functional evenness, <em>i.e</em> the Rao index of quadratic entropy. The Rao index combines species abundance distribution, and the average pairwise functional dissimilarity between species computed by the gower distance.</p>
<p>The impacts of initial disturbance were tested with the Spearman rank correlation between the extremes of taxonomic and functional metrics reached over the 30 years and the initial %AGB loss. They were besides analyzed through polynomial regression between (i) taxonomic and functional richness and evenness and (ii) the initial %AGB loss at 10, 20 and 30 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>Functional redundancy was measured as the overlap among species in community functional space <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. First, the individuals of the trait database were mapped in the plane of the two first axes from a PCA analysis. Then, for each species, the traits probability density (TPD) were computed through two-dimension kernel density estimators. Second, for each community, the TDB weigthed by species abundance were summed accross the functional space. Third, the functional space was divided into a 100 x 100 grid and the number of species with a positive TDP was counted in each cell. The average count across cells minus 1 returnedthe Community Functional Redundancy, which was the average number of species in the community that share the same trait values.</p>
