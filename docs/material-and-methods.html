<p>Paracou station in French Guiana (5°18’N and 52°53’W) is located in a lowland tropical rain forest corresponding to a tropical wet climate with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y<sup>-1</sup> (30-y period) with a 3-month dry season (&lt; 100 mm.month<sup>-1</sup>) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>. Elevation ranges between 5 and 50 m and mean annual temperature is 26°C. Soils correspond to thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability generating lateral drainage during heavy rains. The experiment corresponds to a network of twelve 6.25ha plots that have undergone a gradient of three logging, thinning and fuelwood treatments (Table <a href="material-and-methods.html#tab:Tab1">2.1</a>). Disturbance treatments were attributed according to a randomized plot design with three replicate blocks of four plots. The disturbance corresponds to averages of 10 trees removed per hectare with a diameter at 1.3 m height (DBH) above 50 cm for treatment 1 (T1), 32 trees/ha above 40 cm DBH for treatment 2 (T2) and 40 trees above 40 cm DBH for treatment 3 (T3). Treatments T2 and T3 besides included the thinning of trees by poison girdling <span class="citation">(Blanc et al. 2009)</span>. The disturbance intensity was measured as the percentage of aboveground biomass (%AGB) lost between the first inventory in 1984 and five years after disturbance (ref to be found). Biomass measurements were performed with the BIOMASS package R package <span class="citation">(Réjou-Méchain et al. 2018)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories protocol and dataset collection</h2>
<p>The study site corresponds to a tropical rainforest with a dominance of Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae botanical families. In the twelve experimental plots of the experiment, all trees above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984. During inventories, trees were first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the field team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by a botanist during regular botanical campaigns. In 1984, specific vernacular names were given to 62 commercial or common species whereas other less common species were identified under two identifiers only separating trees and palm trees. The botanical campaigns carried every 5 to 6 years to identify all trees at the species level only started in 2003 and identification practices varied among plots and successive campaigns. This raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species, resulting in significant taxonomic uncertainties that had to be propagated to composition and diversity metrics through a Bayesian framework. The uncertainty propagation was done by the replenishment of inventories completed at genus level from real incomplete ones on the basis of vernacular/botanical names association.</p>
<p>Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials <span class="math inline">\(M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2, …, s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,…, \alpha_3\big]\Big)\)</span> based on the observed association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,…, \alpha_3\big]\)</span> between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and the species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2, …, s_N\big]\)</span> recorded in the inventory. See appendix 1 and <span class="citation">Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology.</p>
<p>The functional diversity metrics used a dataset for 6 functional traits representing leaf economics (leaves thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area, the leaf area per unit dry mass) and wood economics (wood specific gravity and bark thickness), and life history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass).</p>
<p>The trait database came from the BRIDGE project<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> where trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou. Missing trait values were filled using multivariate imputation by chained equation (mice) restricted to samples pertaining to the next higher taxonomic level, in order to account for the phylogenetic signal of the functional traits. The dataset comprised 294 botanical species pertaining to 157 botanical genera.</p>
<p>Whenever a species inventoried was not in the dataset, it was attributed a set of traits values randomly sampled among species of the same next higher taxonomic level. As seed mass information corresponds to a classification into mass classes, no data filling process was applied so analysis were performed considering the 414 botanical species of the seed mass dataset. All composition and diversity metrics corresponded to the average obtained after 50 iterations of the taxonomic uncertainty propagation framework and of the filling process of missing trait values.</p>

<div id="composition-and-diversity-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Composition and diversity metrics</h2>
<p>To counter the remaining taxonomic uncertainty, plots taxonomic composition and diversity were analysed at the genus level, <em>i.e.</em> referring to the genus of observed or trialed botanical names. Variations in plots taxonomic and functional composition after disturbance was visualized by their trajectories over 30 years in a two-dimensional ordination space. Two NMDS were conducted, either from taxonomic flora inventories or from plots functional composition based on the 7 leaf, stem and life history traits (without seed mass classes). In both cases the NMDS were performed using occurrence-based (Jaccard) as well as abundance-based (Bray-Curtis) dissimilarity measures. Trajectories along time were reported through the euclidean distance of successive inventories to the reference inventories in 1989, 5 years after disturbance, when the uncertainty degree did not exceed 30% of undetermined trees. The trajectories of the leaf and stem and life traits were also visualized with the community weighted means (CWM), representing the average trait value in a community weighted by relative abundance of the species carrying each value <span class="citation">(Sandra Díaz et al. 2007; E. et al. Garnier 2004)</span>. To compensate the intrinsinc difference among plots the trajectories corresponded to the differences along time with the reference inventory in 1989. Species seed mass corresponded to 5 classes of increasing mass, seed mass trajectories were therefore reported as the proportion of each class in the inventories.</p>
<p>The taxonomic diversity was assessed through Richness and the Hill number translation of Shannon and Simpson indices <span class="citation">(Hill 1973)</span>. These three indices belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0, 1 and 2 order of diversity (q), which proved well suited for diversity studies <span class="citation">(Patil and C. 1982; Tothmeresz and Tóthmérész 1995)</span>. The functional diversity was reported using the Rao index of quadratic entropy which combines species abundance distribution and average pairwise dissimilarity based on all functional and life traits.</p>
<p>The functional redundancy was measured as the overlap among species in communities’ functional space <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The samples of the trait database were first located with a PCA analysis in a two-dimensional functional space summarizing the 8 functional traits considered. We choose to summarize species functional space through a PCA because functional traits considered were already somehow redundant and allows not to overweight the role of one trait. Then, multivariate kernel density estimator associated with individual trees were summed to give the distribution of traits probabilites of each species. For each community the trait probability distributions of corresponding species were combined and weighted by species abundance. Eventually communities functional redundancy was measured as the sum of overlap between species weighted functional density. Communities functional redundancy is expressed as the average number of species that could be removed from the community without reducing the functional space.</p>
