<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study site</h2>
<p>Paracou station in French Guiana (518’N and 5253’W) is located in a lowland tropical rain forest in a tropical wet climate with mean annual temperature of 26C, mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y<sup>-1</sup> (30-y period) and a 3-month dry season (&lt; 100 mm.month<sup>-1</sup>) from mid-August to mid-November, and a one-month dry season in March <span class="citation">(Wagner et al. 2011)</span>. Elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m. Across all plots the topography mainly corresponds to hilltops or hillsides, while bottomlands cover less than 1 % of the area. Plots are shallow ferralitic acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low permeability and lateral drainage. Soil conditions are homogeneous, to the exception of the highest hilltops where the thick surface allows a free vertical drainage <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>The experiment is a network of twelve 6.25 ha plots (Table <a href="#tab:Tab1"><strong>??</strong></a>) that underwent three disturbance treatments in 1987 according to a randomized plot design <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>.<br />
The experiment comprised three replicates of three sylvicultural treatments (hereafter plots T1, T2 and T3) and three control plots (T0). All treatments T1, T2 and T3 comprised the logging of 10 trees/ha with 50 cm minimum DBH that belonged to a set of 58 commercial species <span class="citation">(Gourlet-Fleury, Guehl, and Laroussinie 2004)</span>. Treatment T2 additionally comprised a thinning treatment by poison-girdling of non-commercial, randomly selected species with an average 30 trees/ha with 40 cm minimum DBH. Treatment T3 additionally comprised the logging of 15 trees /ha with 40 cm minimum DBH and the poison-gidling of 20 trees/ha with a 50 cm minimum DBH, all belonging to non-commercial species. Considering the silvicultural treatments and the following damage, disturbance intensity was measured as the percentage of aboveground biomass (%AGB) lost between the first inventory in 1984 and five years after disturbance <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016)</span> estimated with the BIOMASS R package <span class="citation">(Réjou-Méchain et al. 2017)</span>. The three treatments were then transformed into a continuous disturbance intensity gradient with increasing of above-ground biomass (AGB) lost.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Inventories protocol and dataset collection</h2>
<p>The study site corresponds to a tropical rainforest typical of the Guiana Shield with a dominance of <em>Fabaceae</em>, <em>Chrysobalanaceae</em>, <em>Lecythidaceae</em> and <em>Sapotaceae</em>. In the 12 experimental plots, all trees above 10 cm DBH have been mapped and measured annually since 1984. Trees are first identified with a vernacular name assigned by the forest worker team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by botanists during regular botanical campaigns. In 1984, specific vernacular names were given to 62 commercial or common species whereas more infrequent ones were identified under general identifiers only distinguishing trees and palms. From 2003, botanical campaigns have been conducted every 5 to 6 years to identify all trees at the species level but identification levels still varied among plots and campaigns.</p>
<p>This variability of protocols in time raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually correspond to different botanical species. This resulted in significant taxonomic uncertainty that had to be propagated to composition and diversity metrics. The uncertainty propagation was done through a Bayesian framework reconstituting complete inventories at genus level from real incomplete ones on the basis of vernacular/botanical names association. Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials based on the association probability <span class="math inline">\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_V\big]\)</span> observed across all inventories between each vernacular name <em>v</em> and all species <span class="math inline">\(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big]\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2,..., s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,..., \alpha_V\big]\Big) \nonumber
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>See Supplementary Materials -Fig. S1 and <span class="citation">Aubry-Kientz et al. (2013)</span> for the detailed methodology.</p>
<p>Six functional traits representing leaf economics (leaf thickness, toughness, total chlorophyll content and specific leaf area) and stem economics (wood specific gravity and bark thickness) came from the BRIDGE project.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou, and comprised 294 species pertaining to 157 genera. Whenever a species was in the dataset but missed some trait values (10% of the species), missing values were filled using multivariate imputation by chained equation <span class="citation">(van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011)</span>. To account for the phylogenetic signal in the filling process, imputations based on samples from the same genus or from the same family. Whenever a species was not in the dataset, it was attributed a set of trait values randomly sampled among species of the next higher taxonomic level (same genus or family). Two life-history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass) came from the Mariwenn database.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The database compiles information from a vast literature on the flora of French Guiana <span class="citation">(Ollivier, Baraloto, and Marcon 2007)</span> and comprises 362 species pertaining to 188 genera. As seed mass information was classified into classes, no data filling process was applied and analyses were restricted to the botanical species recorded.</p>
<p>All composition and diversity metrics were obtained after 50 iterations of the uncertainty propagation framework.</p>

<div id="composition-and-diversity-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Composition and diversity metrics</h2>
<p>Because of the variability in the precision of botanical identification efforts, we were constrained to conduct the taxonomic composition and diversity analysis at the genus level. Taxonomic and functional trajectories of community composition were followed in a two-dimensional NMDS ordination plane. Two NMDS using abundance-based (Bray-Curtis) dissimilarity measures were conducted to map either taxonomic or functional composition, the latter based on the seven leaf, stem and life history traits (without seed mass classes). Trajectories along time were reported through the Euclidean distance between the target inventories and the reference pre-disturbance inventories of 1984. Univariate trajectories of the leaf, stem and life-history traits were also visualized with the community weighted means (CWM) <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2007)</span>. Species seed mass were given in 5 mass classes, and seed mass trajectories were reported as the proportion of each class in the inventories (Supplementary materials).</p>
<p>The taxonomic and functional trajectories were analysed from the reference pre-disturbance inventories of 1984. The taxonomic diversity was reported through species richness and the Hill number translation of the Simpson index <span class="citation">(Hill 1973)</span>. These metrics allowed assessing the taxonomic richness as well as evenness, through the comparison between these two metrics: results will be discussed directly in terms of taxonomic richness and evenness. Both indices belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy, respectively corresponding to the 0 and 2 order of diversity (q), recommended for diversity studies <span class="citation">(Marcon and Hérault 2015)</span>. The functional diversity was reported using the functional richness and functional evenness, through the Rao index of quadratic entropy. The Rao index combines species abundance distribution, and the average pairwise functional dissimilarity between species computed by the Gower distance.</p>
<p>The impacts of the initial disturbance levels on the maximum gain or loss in richness and evenness were tested with the Spearman rank correlation tests. Richness and evenness trajectories were besides analyzed through polynomial regression between (i) taxonomic and functional richness and evenness and (ii) the initial %AGB loss at 10, 20 and 30 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>Finally, functional redundancy was measured as the overlap among species in community functional space <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. First, the individuals of the trait database were mapped in the plane of the first two axes from a PCA analysis, which lowered the weight of correlations among traits as the PCA axes were combinations of most decoupled traits. For each species, the traits probability density (TPD) were computed from the mapping of individuals through two-dimension kernel density estimators. Second, for each community, the TPD weigthed by species abundance were summed accross the functional space. Third, the functional space was divided into a 100 x 100 grid and the number of species with a positive TPD was counted in each cell. The average count across cells minus 1 returned the Community Functional Redundancy, which was the average number of species in the community that share the same trait values.</p>
