<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A validation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>The monitoring of disturbed forest communities confirmed a limited negative impact of disturbance on species richness, as observed on several post logging surveys <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. Thirty years after disturbance, the genus richness was restored to initial plot values after high disturbance intensity while it substantially increased after low disturbance intensity, reaching a gain of almost 12 genera for some plots.</p>
<p>Both richness and evenness followed asymptotic trajectories after disturbance, sharply increasing for 15 years before stabilizing at higher values than those of control plots. An increase of communities evenness stems from a higher homogeneity of species distribution. After disturbance, communities are made of the old, pre-disturbance survivors and the newly recruited trees: changes in composition and abundance distribution are to be found in the recruitment processes and in the pre-disturbance survivors mortality. Because the composition of old survivors proved to mirror the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, a specific turnover was expected among recruited trees with enhanced growth and survival of previously infrequent species. Indeed, the increase in taxonomic diversity was accompanied by an increase of taxonomic dissimilarity with plots initial state and a functional shift towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf toughness and maximum height) <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Disturbance then causes a reorganization of the typical high dominance structure of hyperdiverse mature forests after disturbance, benefiting to pioneers and light demanding species. Likely, the changes in abiotic environment and competitive pressure favored pioneers which outcompete others in non limiting resources but are excluded in mature forests by long-lived, more resistant and shade tolerant species.</p>
<p>As stated by the IDH, communities dynamics after disturbance relied on species functional strategy and corresponding ability to fill the environmental niches made available by disturbance. Recruited species then mixed with pre-disturbance ones, from which they differed, and constituted a community all the more diversified that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>.</p>

<div id="on-the-recovery-of-disturbed-communities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the recovery of disturbed communities</h2>
<p>All diversity and composition trajectories followed similar hump-back trajectories returning towards their initial values. Communities trajectories therefore illustrated their taxonomic and function resilience.</p>
<p>Because functional traits and functional diversity are the most direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, their resilience meant a consistent recovery of ecosystem processes in the long term <span class="citation">(Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. The resilience of the taxonomic diversity and composition similarly translated the recovery of communities such as before disturbance. This resilience meant the maintenance of communities initial differences in composition and supported the idea of their convergence towards a determined state <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. If all plots followed similar hump-back trajectories, though, some significant differences emerged. To name but one, the taxonomic evenness of one plot displayed an extensive increase until 30 years after disturbance. The differences trajectories maxima and time path, along with the fact intrinsinc communities differences are maintained, suggested that the trajectories depend on the initial plots composition or on some abiotic parameters <span class="citation">(Anderson 2007)</span>.</p>

<div id="functional-redundancy-of-disturbed-ecosystems" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Functional redundancy of disturbed ecosystems</h2>
<p>Despite the recovery of pre-disturbance state there was a time lag between the trajectories followed by communities taxonomic and functional characteristics. The trajectory of taxonomic composition and evenness had a longer time-path and remained altered while communities functional composition and diversity had already recovered.</p>
<p>Such delay between functional and taxonomic dynamics was already observed for grasslands <span class="citation">(D. Tilman 1997; D. Mouillot et al. 2011)</span> and more recently for tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. According to the “vegetation quantity effect” <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span>, the functional diversity of communities rely on the dominant species. Communities functional trajectories were then driven first by the increase in diversity and evenness of dominant species, which restored the pre-disturbance functional characteristics. Then, the functional trajectories were driven by the recruitment of species resembling the old pre-disturbance community, which reduced the overall diversity. At that time, the taxonomic composition and diversity remained altered: the still missing species were then the initially infrequent and functionally redundant ones. The functional redundancy, the functional overlap between species that is typical of the huge biodiversity of tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>, was then not restored 30 years after disturbance and this is major to consider as it defines forests’ resilience <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Besides the long-term alteration of functional redundancy, there was probably persistent compositional changes favoring disturbance resistant species <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008)</span>, lianas or epiphytes <span class="citation">(P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span> and environmental changes, like in the soils nutrient cycling and compaction <span class="citation">(Olander, Bustamante, and Asner 2005)</span>. These persistent changes highly question forest’s resilience <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2003)</span>. New conditions would not only be longer lasting but self-maintained as tied to disturbance regime <span class="citation">(Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000)</span>. Specificaly, this would impair species contingent to undisturbed forests, threatening their maintenance, and run the risk to loose cornerstone species and trigger unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
