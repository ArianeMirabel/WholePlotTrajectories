<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A cyclic recovery of community composition</h2>
<p>Communities taxonomic and functional composition appeared resilient, following similar hump-shaped trajectories starting to return towards pre-disturbance composition after 30 years. The taxonomic differences among communities, marked before disturbance by the distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2, were maintained throughout recovery trajectories. More than commonly thought, post-disturbance trajectories depended on community initial composition, that partly determined the pool of recruited species and constrained the trajectories towards the initial composition. The high resilience of communities taxonomy revealed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were hardly recruited because of the commonness of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(SVENNING and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Trajectories of community functional composition appeared similar in time and close in terms of functional composition. Because pre-disturbance surviving trees mirror the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, changes in functional composition relied upon the recruitment of species or functional types infrequent or absent before disturbance. Competitive pioneers became dominant in filling the environmental niches of high availability of light, space and nutrient made available by the disturbance. It changed community functional composition in the same way for all communities, towards more resource-acquisitive strategies <span class="citation">(Grime 1998; Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Later during the community recovery long-lived, more resistant and shade-tolerant species, would exclude those pioneers and restore the pre-disturbance composition.</p>

<div id="another-perspective-on-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Another perspective on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Disturbance appeared to enhance community taxonomic richness until an intensity threshold (20-25% of initial AGB loss), while the taxonomic evenness was somewhat decoupled from the disturbance intensity as already observed in the Guiana Shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Bornean tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>. The IDH well predicted the disturbance impact on community taxonomic richness and to some extent on taxonomic evenness. The disturbance intensity determines the balance in the community between pre-disturbance surviving trees and the trees recruited afterward. In the Guiana Shield, the pool of true pioneer species specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. Cecropia spp., Vismia spp.). Below the intensity threshold the size of the surviving community maintains its pre-disturbance taxonomic richness and the recruitment of pioneers, infrequent or absent before disturbance, increases both community taxonomic richness and evenness. Beyond the intensity threshold the taxonomic diversity of the surviving trees decreases and is not offset by the taxonomic enrichment of pioneers. The disturbance impact was similar but slighter for community taxonomic evenness, that is less sensitive to the loss of rare species and rather represents the increased dominance of pionneers that balanced the usual hyper-dominance of tropical forest. While below the intensity threshold pioneers species increase the diversity of dominant or common species, beyond the threshold they become in turn highly dominant.</p>
<p>Conversely the IDH was disproved to predict the dsiturbance impact on community functional diversity. Pioneer species were functionally highly different from the pre-disturbance community composition, so their recruitment increased the community functional richness and eveness whenever its intensity.</p>
<p>Along time, the post-disturbance taxonomic richness trajectories showed first a similar drop following the species loss during disturbance, and then a species gain determined by the disturbance intensity. Until an intensity threshold the gain in taxonomic richness increased with the disturbance intensity through the establishment of long-lived pioneers enhancing community taxonomic richness and evenness in the long term. These long-lived pionneers were functionally quite different from the functional composition and their establishment entailed a progressive and long-lasting increase of the functional diversity. Beyond the intensity threshold a few short-lived pioneers occupied the vacated environmental space and prevented further species establishment. These short-lived pioneers were functionally very different from the pre-disturbance community and rapidly and significantly increased the functional diversity. Already after 10 years, though, they started to decline and the functional diversity started to decrease. Likely the establishment of long-lasting pioneers will follow and we expect the taxonomic and functional trajectories to catch up with those observed after intermediate disturbance.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of the community resilience</h2>
<p>For 15 years the species loss during disturbance, determined by the disturbance intensity, commensurately decreased the functional redundancy within the pre-disturbance functional space. At first place the pioneers recruited, functionally different from the pre-disturbance functional composition did not compensate for the reundancy decrease. Progressively though, first establish species were replaced by more competitive long-lived pionneers or late-successional species resembling more the pre-disturbance functional composition and restoring the functional redundancy. This replacement was stochastic and followed the lottery recruitment rules, that ease the recovery for the first recruited species but then increasingly hamper it with the emergence of interspecific competition due to increasing functional redundancy <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Along time the recovery of infrequent species is increasingly difficult, and the recovery of the functional redundancy that was just initiated after 30 years in some communities is difficult to estimate <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The long-term impact of disturbance on community functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of pre-disturbance communities and higher chances to see the persistence of disturbance-specific species at the expense of late-successional ones <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>. Besides the long-term recovery of infrequent species increases the risks to loose cornerstone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>. Apart from the functional characteristics considered here, infrequent species might indeed have unique functions in the ecosystem or be a key for some fauna.</p>
