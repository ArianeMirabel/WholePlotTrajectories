<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>Our analysis highlighted the decoupling between functional and taxonomic trajectories, with taxonomic trajectories maintaining initial differences among plots while functional trajectories remained similar. We revealed that if the IDH explained the taxonomic response to disturbance, it was not validated regarding the functional response. The decoupling between taxonomic and functional response was linked to the disturbance impact on the functional redundancy, that proved determining in community recovery.</p>
<div id="decoupled-taxonomic-and-functional-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decoupled taxonomic and functional trajectories</h2>
<p>Regarding taxonomic composition, the different tree communities were substantially different before disturbance, and this is visualized by their distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2. These initial differences were maintained all along the 30 years following disturbance, with the disturbance leading a displacement on the NMDS axis 1 only. Changes were thus similar and may correspond to the recruitment of a group of pioneers, e.g. <em>Cecropia</em> spp., <em>Vismia</em> spp., shared by all plots and whatever their initial taxonomic differences and the intensity of disturbance <span class="citation">(Julie S Denslow and Guzman 2000; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. Taxonomic trajectories seems to start a recovery to the initial composition which, although far from fully achieved after 30 years, suggested that taxonomic composition is resilient and that the initial differences will be maintained in time <span class="citation">(C. Folke 2006)</span>. This would show that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were rarely recruited in the long-term, probably because of the common dispersal limitations among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Regarding functional composition, initial communities had similar starting points and this contrasts to taxonomic composition. This means that, despite differences in species composition, the functional signature of the tree communities were quite similar. Following disturbance, functional trajectories were consistent in the NMDS plane with displacement intensities linked to disturbance intensities and thus relied upon the recruitment of a shared pool of functional types previously infrequent or absent. This common pool is composed of pioneer resource-acquisitive (low leaf toughness, wood specific gravity, maximum height and high Specific Leaf area) strategies that translated by a displacement to the right along the first NMDS axis <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Thereafter, the pioneers recruited primarily were progressively excluded by long-lived, more competitive and shade-tolerant species. The community functional composition then quickly returned towards more resource-conservative strategies, suggesting the recovery of the initial functional composition. This recovery translated in the functional plane by a displacement left along the first axis and upward along the second axis (Fig. ).</p>
<p>Both taxonomic and functional composition trajectories initiated a return towards pre-disturbance state after 30 years, which highlighted the taxonomic and functional resilience of communities. Taxonomic and functional trajectories however appeared decoupled: while taxonomic trajectories maintained the initial differences among communities, the functional trajectories where similar and convergent in the functional space <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span> exemplifying the simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects that shapes tree community assembly in this forest, making it both deterministic in functional space and historically contingent in taxonomic space.</p>

<div id="the-scope-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The scope of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Community trajectories depended on the disturbance intensity, with a threshold of 20-25% of AGB loss for which the taxonomic richness was maximized and the taxonomic evenness remained resilient. Below a disturbance intensity threshold (treatments 1 and 2), the taxonomic richness increased and the taxonomic eveness increased first before stabilizing or starting to decrease. In those cases, the trees surviving after disturbance remained numerous enough to maintain the high taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. In parallel, the recruitment of pioneers, infrequent or absent before disturbance, increased the taxonomic richness all the more so that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(Martin et al. 2015; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. As these pioneers became more dominant they balanced the usual hyper-dominance of tropical forests and increased the taxonomic evenness <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. Contrastingly, above the intensity threshold (treatment 3), the taxonomic richness did not exceed the initial value and the taxonomic evenness continuously increased without sign of reversal. Above the intensity threshold, the taxonomic richness of surviving trees was too low to be offset by the recruitment of pioneers. In the Guiana shield indeed, the pool of true pioneers specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. <em>Cecropia</em> spp., <em>Vismia</em> spp.) <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018)</span>. At the same time, pioneers became persistently dominant and prevented a return towards the initial evenness and the recovery of hyper-dominant shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>After disturbance of intermediate intensity, taxonomic evenness trajectories were hump-shaped, as already observed in the Guiana shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Bornean tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>. Trajectories peaked at an intermediate time after disturbance, around 15-20 years. This time corresponded to a balance between first established pioneers and the more competitve late-successional species.</p>
<p>Regarding community functional trajectories in contrast, there was neither intermediate disturbance intensity nor intermediate time after disturbance, which dismissed the IDH. Neither functional richness nor functional evenness displayed a humped-shaped pattern, but both rather increased with the recruitment of pioneers that were functionally highly different from the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Julie Sloan Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Above the intensity threshold however, for the most intense disturbance, community functional richness and evenness started to decrease after 15 to 20 years. Right after disturbance, short-lived species benefited from the resources made available and prevented the establishment of other species. The decline of these short-lived pioneers decreased the functional richness and evenness, but we suggest that the establishment of long-lasting pioneers will follow and that the trajectories will catch up with those observed for intermediate disturbance <span class="citation">(L. R. Walker and Moral 2009)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-functional-redundancy-key-of-community-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of community resilience</h2>
<p>The loss of species following disturbance decreased the functional redundancy during the first 15 years. Progressively though, the functional redundancy was restored through the replacement of the resource-acquisitive strategies species by more late-successional species that were functionally closer to the pre-disturbance community. This replacement followed the lottery recruitment rules, implying an easy recruitment for the first species but becoming increasingly hampered by the emergence of interspecific competition <span class="citation">(Busing and Brokaw 2002)</span> and this explains why the slope of the recovery trajectory became less and less significant 20 years after disturbance. The recovery of the functional redundancy then relied upon the random process of species recruitment and was increasingly slow and difficult to anticipate <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. This suggests a low resilience of the functional redundancy with the random recovery of infrequent species increasing the risks to lose keystone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; R. L. Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Infrequent species might indeed have unique functional characteristics, apart from those considered here, in the ecosystem or be a key resource for some fauna <span class="citation">(Schleuning et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
