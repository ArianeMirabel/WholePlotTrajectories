<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decoupled taxonomic and functional composition trajectories</h2>
<p>Before disturbance, the different communities had different taxonomic compositions, visualized by their distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2. These initial differences were maintained all along the 30 years following disturbance, with post-disturbance trajectories corresponding to a displacement on the NMDS axis 1. The taxonomic compositional changes following disturbance were similar among communities, which may correspond to the recruitment of a group of pioneers common to all communities whenever their initial differences and the disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(Julie S Denslow and Guzman 2000; Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. Taxonomic trajectories continued with a recovery of the initial composition which, althought not fully achieved after 30 years, suggested the community taxonomic resilience and the maintenance of community initial differences <span class="citation">(C. Folke 2006)</span>. The return towards initial taxonomic composition showed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were rarely recruited, probably because of the common dispersal limitations among tropical tree species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Regarding functional composition, initial communities were similar and trajectories were confounded in the functional space. Following disturbance, the functional composition of pre-disturbance surviving trees is belived to be the same as this of the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Post-disturbance changes in functional composition then relied upon the recruitment of species or functional types previously infrequent or absent. These species were probably competitive pioneers becoming dominant as the most efficient to benefit from the light, space and nutrients made available by disturbance. This recruitment of pioneers drove functional composition trajectories similar for all plots and disturbance intensity. The composition first went towards more resource-acquisitive strategies, which was translated by a displacement on the right along the first axis in the functional plan <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Thereafter, the pioneers recruited primarily were progressively excluded by long-lived, more resistant and shade-tolerant species. The community functional composition then returned towards more resource-conservative strategies, suggesting the recovery of the initial community composition and translated in the functional plan by a displacement left along the first axis and upward along the second axis (Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:NMDSplans">3.1</a>).</p>
<p>Both taxonomic and functional composition trajectories initiated a return towards pre-disturbance state after 30 years, which highlighted community taxonomic and functional resilience. There was however a decoupling between taxonomic and functional composition trajectories as taxonomic trajectories maintained the initial differences among communities, while functional trajectories where similar and convergent in the functional space <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-scope-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The scope of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Community taxonomic richness and evenness trajectories were determined by the disturbance intensity, ranging from a limited and temporary impact to significant and persistant alterations of community diversity. The taxonomic trajectories markedly changed above an intensity threshold for which the taxonomic richness was maximized and the taxonomic evenness remained resilient. The disturbance intensity determined the balance in the community between pre-disturbance surviving trees, and trees recruited afterward. Below a 20%-25% AGB loss, the trees surviving after disturbance remained numerous enough to maintain the high taxonomic richness of the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. The recruitment of pionners, infrequent or absent before disturbance, then increased the taxonomic richness all the more so that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(Martin et al. 2015; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. As these pioneers became more dominant they balanced the usual hyper-dominance of tropical forests, hence temporarily increasing the taxonomic evenness <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. Above the intensity threshold, the taxonomic richness of surviving trees was too low to be offset by the recruitment of pioneers. In the Guiana shield indeed, the pool of true pioneers specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. <em>Cecropia</em> spp., <em>Vismia</em> spp.) <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018)</span>. The taxonomic richness then decreased following intense disturbance, all the more so that the disturbance intensity was high <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. At the same time, pioneers became persistently dominant and prevented a return towards the initial evenness and the recovery of hyper-dominant shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Taxonomic trajectories following disturbance of intermediate intensity besides highlighted an intermediate time after disturbance, around 15-20 years, for which the taxonomic evenness was maximized. As already observed in the Guiana shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Borenan tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>, taxonomic evenness followed hump-shaped trajectories with a peak when the recruitment was balanced between pioneers and late-successional species. This intermediate time corresponded to the match between the generation time of pionneers, first to dominate the post-disturbance recruitment, and the time for competitive exclusion to emerge, which leads to the dominance of late-successional species.</p>
<p>Regarding community functional trajectories in contrast, there was neither intermediate disturbance intensity nor intermediate time after disturbance, which dismissed the IDH. Neither functional richness nor functional evenness displayed a humped-shaped pattern, but both rather increased with the recruitment of pioneers that were functionally highly different from the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Julie Sloan Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Above the intensity threshold however, for the most intense disturbance, community functional richness and evenness started to decrease after 15 to 20 years. The right after disturbance, short-lived species benefited from the resources made available and prevented the establishment of other species. The decline of these short-lived pioneers decreased the functional richness and evenness, but we suggest that the establishment of long-lasting pioneers will follow and that the trajectories will catch up with those observed for intermediate disturbance <span class="citation">(L. R. Walker and Moral 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The IDH then translated into community taxonomic response, with post-disturbance trajectories markedly different below and above an intensity threshold. The IDH was also valid at an intermediate time after disturbance, when the recruitment of early- and late-successional species were balanced. Functional trajectories, however, remained decoupled from taxonomic ones and dismissed the IDH.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of community resilience</h2>
<p>The decoupling between taxonomic and functional trajectories was explained by a decrease in the functional redundancy within the pre-disturbance functional space, due to the loss of species following disturbance. The recruitment of pioneers, functionally different from the pre-disturbance functional composition, did not compensate the decrease of functional redundancy in the first place. Progressively though, the functional redundancy was restored through the replacement of the first established species by more competitive, long-lived pioneers or late-successional species that were functionally closer to the pre-disturbance community. This replacement followed the lottery recruitment rules, implying an recruitment easy for the first species but becoming increasingly hampered by the emergence of interspecific competition <span class="citation">(Busing and Brokaw 2002)</span>. The recovery of the functional redundancy then relied upon the random processe of species recruitment and was increasingly slow and difficult to anticipate <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The impact of disturbance on community functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of the disturbed communities, with higher chances to see the settltement of pioneers and early-successional species at the expense of late-successional ones <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008)</span>. Besides, the random recovery of infrequent species increases the risks to lose keystone species, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; R. L. Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Infrequent species might indeed have unique functional characteristics, apart from those considered here, in the ecosystem or be a key for some fauna <span class="citation">(Schleuning et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
