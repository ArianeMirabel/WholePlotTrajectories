<p>Our study showed the significant impact of disturbance on tropical forests communities. The subsequent diversity trajectories confirmed the intermediate disturbance hypothesis debated for tropical forests through their correlation with disturbance intensity. Besides it revealed the contrasting response of taxonomic and functional characteristics, specifically the decoupling between communities taxonomic evenness and their functional diversity and dominant functional traits values. The long-term disturbance trajectories observed highlighted the unachieved but consistent recovery of communities assembly for the lowest disturbance intensity but questioned it after higher disturbance.</p>
<p>In line with the “vegetation quantity effect” suggesting that communities functional characteristics depends on dominant species rather that subtle changes in biodiversity <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span>. This would result in a faster recovery of ecosystem processes rates than composition and diversity as demonstrated for grasslands <span class="citation">(D. Tilman 1997; D. Mouillot et al. 2011)</span> and more recently for tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lohbeck, Lebrija-trejos, and Martínez-ramos 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. This highlighted the functional overlap between species in tropical forests, typical of their huge biodiversity, and intricately questioned the different facets of communities resilience. Ecosystem processes grasped through the set of functional traits retained here however do not assess communities resilience and future dynamics.</p>
<p>In line with the assumtions of the IDH the observed diversity trajectories confirmed the increase of communities evenness and functional richness after disturbance. The consistency of the IDH has been debated for the higly diverse tropical forests, some observing the importance of environmental filters to shape communities assembly and others arguing for a genuine stochastic recovery <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Consistently to the trajectories drawn here, a previous study of the same experiment revealed the directional changes in communities composition reflecting environmental filtering after disturbance <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. Disturbance regimes brought a unimodal response depending on disturbance intensity as suggested by the outcome of 10 years and 20 years post-disturbance analysis<span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. As observed after logging in a Boranean rainforest <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span> or after cyclones in the Solomon islands <span class="citation">(Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000)</span>, communities diversity showed a unimodal response to disturbance and a maintenance of diversity levels, except for one of the intensively disturbed community which evenness was still increasing (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig5">3.5</a>). Despite the recovery of communities diversity, though, taxonomic composition was clearly altered (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>) implying a long-term, if not permenant, composition change after disturbance as observed in East African tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bonnell, Reyna-Hurtado, and Chapman 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>Regarding the functional trajectories and dominant trait values of disturbed communities (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig3">3.3</a>), disturbance appeared to favor acquisitive strategies, <em>i.e</em> species with high SLA, low wood density, small seeds, etc <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. The comparison of observed trajectories to a null model with random traits set shuffling showed an oriented functional shift after disturbance which suggest additional biotic and abiotic filters for the 10 to 15 years after disturbance. This means a shift from exclusive competition favoring competitive species before disturbance to environmental filtering selecting acquisitive and disturbance resistant species. In particular, the evolution seed mass classes proportions (Figure <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>) revealed a clear increase in small seeded, therefore large dispersive, species <span class="citation">(TerSteege and Hammond 2001; Flores, Gourlet-Fleury, and Picard 2006; Haddad et al. 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>The diversity and composition functional trajectories showed a decoupling between functional and taxonomic after the most intense disturbance (treatments T2 and T3). Plots functional characteristic returned to their initial values, similar to those of control plots, faster than their taxonomic counterparts (Figures <a href="results.html#fig:Fig2">3.2</a> to <a href="results.html#fig:Fig4">3.4</a>). As functional traits are the most direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span> the recovery of communities functional characteristics would go along the recovery of ecosystems processes although taxonomic composition remain altered <span class="citation">(Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. Such decoupling suggested the consistency of functional overlap and maybe functional versatility, implying a variety of functioning from the same characteristic, in the pre-disturbance condition. Functional overlap has been observed in highly diverse ecosystems <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> and suggested as one mechanisms for high diversity maintenance. Knowing the decoupling between taxonomic and functional trajectories, this functional overlap may not be recovering after disturbance and therefore radically modify communities resilience and resistance <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Given the impaired functional overlap, the persitant compositional changes regarding disturbance resistant species <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008)</span> and probably lianas or epiphytes <span class="citation">(P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>, and the modification of environmental conditions like soils nutrient cycling and compaction <span class="citation">(Olander, Bustamante, and Asner 2005)</span> the entirety of communities recovery after intense disturbance is deeply questioned <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2003)</span>. New conditions would not only be longer lasting but self-maintained as tied to disturbance regime <span class="citation">(Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000)</span>. Although communities recovered the core of their initial functioning, composition seemed permanently altered after intense disturbance. Specificaly, this would impair species contingent to undisturbed forests, threatening their maintenance, and run the risk to loose cornerstone species and trigger unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>To confirm this long-term communities changes and highlight the ecological rules shaping communities assembly, we suggest a focus on recruitment dynamics, that would follow the diversity and functional characteristic of recruited communities and, by extension, of the forest to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Important differences among plots of same treatments: possible impact of initial diversity composition, local abiotic parameters (topography, soils, surrounding stands). Impacts depend on the disturbance intensity, but further parameters may be involved.</p>
