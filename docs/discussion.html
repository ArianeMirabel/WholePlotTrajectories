<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A cyclic recovery of community composition</h2>
<p>Communities taxonomic and functional composition appeared resilient, following similar hump-shaped trajectories starting to return towards pre-disturbance composition after 30 years. The taxonomic differences among communities, marked before disturbance by the distinct starting points on the NMDS axis 2, were maintained throughout recovery trajectories. More than commonly thought, post-disturbance trajectories depended on community initial composition, that partly determined the pool of recruited species and constrained the trajectories towards the initial composition. The high resilience of communities taxonomy revealed that species not belonging to the pre-disturbance community were hardly recruited because of the commonness of dispersal limitation among tropical tree species (Svenning, Wright JECOL 2005).</p>
<p>Community functional composition followed similar trajectories that were not so distinct in the functional space……. Because the pre-disturbance survivor trees mirror the initial communities <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, the functional changes relied upon recruited trees and the enhanced growth and survival of previously infrequent species and functional types. Disturbance vacated environmental niches of high light, space and nutrient availability, filled by competitive pioneers that became dominant and determined the functional characteristics of the community <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span>. Before disturbance and over communities recovery time though, these species would be excluded by long-lived, more resistant and shade tolerant species. The recovery of communities functional characteristics, that mostly rely on dominant species according to the “vegetation quantity effect” <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span>, suggested a similar recovery of the dominant species <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>. significant functional shifts towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf toughness and maximum height) <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Another perspective on the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>IDH in Space (Disturbance gradient) The IDH consistently (predicted) the response of functional diversity to disturbance, but the theory was disproved regarding communities taxonomic richness and evenness. The functional range of species that could establish after disturbance was determined by the expanse of the environmental space made available by disturbance.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast the IDH translated in a decrease of the taxonomic richness above an intensity threshold while the taxonomic evenness was decoupled from disturbance intensity, as already observed in the Guiana Shield <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span> and in Bornean tropical forests <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998)</span>. The taxonomic richness and evenness of recruited species was fixed and at community scale the post-disturbance taxonomic characterisitcs depended on the combination of these recruits and the remaining pre-disturbance community.</p>
<p>The intensity of the disturbance determined the balance between trees recruited in the pre-disturbance community and those recruited in disturbance-specific community, functionally more diverse than undisturbed forests but with lower taxonomic richness and higher evenness.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>IDH in Time For the first years following disturbance community functional diversity increased through the filling of the vacated environmental space without competitive exclusion contraints. The maximum functional diversity was reached at the same time so the rate of space filling was similar among communities. The maximum was followed by the emergence of competitive exclusion processes bringing the functional diversity back to pre-disturbance levels and made the disturbance hypothesis intermediate in time.</li>
</ol>
<p>For medium disturbance intensity enhancing the taxonomic richness and evennes, the taxonomic trajectories reached asymptots of high richness and high evenness decoupled from their functional trajectories. Species first established after disturbance remained in the community but became less dominant, replaced the abundant pre-disturbance species, but the recovery of rare species was hampered in the long-term <span class="citation">(Hubbell 2001; J. Chave 2004)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-functional-redundancy-key-of-the-taxonomic-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of the taxonomic resilience</h2>
<p>The recovery of the most infrequent species followed the lottery recruitment rules <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and was hampered by the increasing competition among species, implying long term recovery <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Following disturbance the space and resources made available corresponded to a rapid decrease of the functional redundancy within the initial functional space. The high light, space and nutrient niches were rapidly filled by species, mainly the most dominant and frequent ones. Thereafter competitive exclusion emerged following the filling of the niches and limited the recruitment of infrequent species <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Busing2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The recovery of communities taxonomic richness and evenness relied upon the recovery of the initial functional redudancy. Although underway 30 years after disturbance the recovery remained unachieved and after 30 years the recovery it was underway but remained unachieved. This alteration of the functional redundancy meant a lower resilience of pre-disturbance communities and higher chances to see the persistence of disturbance-specific communities, with less species and more pioneers <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>. Besides the slowed recovery of rare species increased the risks to loose cornerstone specie, with unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>. Apart from the functional characteristics considered here, infrequent species mighthave unique functions i nthe ecosystem or be a key for some fauna.</p>
