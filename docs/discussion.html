<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decoupled taxonomic and functional trajectories</h2>
<p>Both communities taxonomic and functional diversity and composition proved resilient, following similar humped shaped trajectories returning towards initial values. The resilience of communities functional structure, that is the most direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, meant a consistent recovery of ecosystem processes in the long term <span class="citation">(Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. The resilience of communities taxonomy meant the maintenance of their initial differences in composition and diversity, suggesting the existence of multiple stable equilibria as assumed for highly diverse and productive ecosystems <span class="citation">(Chase 2003)</span>. It besides suggested that recovery trajectories depend on the initial composition eventually restored that would the the asymptot of the humped shaped dynamics <span class="citation">(S. P. Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Anderson 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Although both communities taxonomic and functional characteristics proved resilient and followed similar humped shaped trajectories, the taxonomic recovery systematically lagged behind the functional one. The decoupling between functional and taxonomic dynamics has already been observed for grasslands <span class="citation">(D. Tilman 1997; D. Mouillot et al. 2011)</span> and more recently for tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. According to the “vegetation quantity effect” <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span> functional trajectories rely on the pool of dominant species, which diversity and evenness were enhanced after disturbance, and which rapidly recovered their initial functional structure. However, communities evenness remained high so infrequent species still missed to the taxonomic recovery that proved all the more longer to recover that unrecovered species would be functionally redundant and probably underwent competition processes.</p>

<div id="a-validation-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> A validation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Validating the IDH, communities trajectories confirmed the diversity increase after disturbance through an enhanced growth of otherwise less favored species. This was strong regarding the functional diversity but more blurry regarding their taxonomic structure.</p>
<p>The taxonomic richness was weakly or negatively impacted by intense disturbance, as observed on several post logging surveys <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>, while it substantially increased after low intensity disturbance. Disturbance also enhanced taxonomic evenness, but the disturbance intensity was only weakly and lately correlated to communities eveness (<em>i.e.</em> Simpson diversity). Contrastingly, disturbance intensity consistently predicted the significant increase of communities functional diversity for 30 years. Disturbance entailed specific turnover within communities, either among pre-disturbance survivors or among newly recruited trees. As the composition of old-growth survivors proved to mirror initial communities <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, disturbance likely impacted trees recruitment through the enhanced growth and survival of previously infrequent species and functional types. Consistently, disturbance resulted in increasing taxonomic dissimilarity compared to pre-disturbance communities and significant functional shifts towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf toughness and maximum height) <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Disturbance then caused a reorganization of the typical high dominance structure of hyperdiverse mature forests after disturbance, benefiting to pioneers and light demanding species. Likely, the changes in abiotic environment and competitive pressure favored pioneers which outcompete other species in non limiting resources but are excluded in mature forests through the cmpetition with long-lived, more resistant and shade bearers. Therefore, consistently with the IDH the trajectories after disturbance relied on the environmental niches made available by disturbance filled by species from a restrictied functional range. Recruited species therefore differed from pre-disturbance ones, constituting a community all the more diversified that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-functional-redundancy-key-of-communities-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of communities resilience</h2>
<p>Both the lag between taxonomic and functional recovery and the middling consistency of the IDH regarding communities taxonomic diversity made central the role of functional redundancy. Functional redundancy, determinant of communities resilience <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, seemed not to have recovered 30 years after disturbance.</p>
<p>Communities with high functional redundancy are expected to be able to lose species with a limited impact on their functional structure <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. Functional redundancy therefore mitigates the impacts of disturbance, but we expect the redundancy itself to be reduced or re-organized within the functional space. Although the overall functional redundancy did not follow consistent trajectories after disturbance, the redundancy restricted to the functional space of the initial community clearly followed humped shaped trajectories. This restricted redundancy decreased according to the disturbance intensity before returning towards the initial value but had not recovered for any disturbed community after 30 years. The recovery of the redundancy within the initial functional space explained the hampered recovery of infrequent species specific to old-growth forests that would be functionally redundant and therefore underwent competitive pressures limiting species functional similarity <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>. The unachieved humped shaped redundancy trajectory meant a decrease of the resilience of pre-disturbance communities and an increase in the resilience of disturbance-specific communities (corresponding to lower richness and higher dominance of pioneer species). After disturbance the chances were higher to have long lasting or self-maintained compositional changes in favor of disturbance resistant species, lianas or epiphytes <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>, which highly questioned the completeness of the resilience <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2003)</span>. Specificaly, species contingent to undisturbed forests might be impaired, threatening their maintenance, the risk to loose cornerstone species and trigger unexpected ecological consequences would be higher <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
