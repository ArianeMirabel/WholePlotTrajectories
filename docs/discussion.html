<p>Our analysis revealed that community post-disturbance trajectories in taxonomic and functional diversity and composition were decoupled. The taxonomic composition specificities between communities before disturbance were maintained following disturbance, while their functional composition converged in the functional space.  In terms of diversity, only the taxonomic trajectories validated the IDH that explained humped-shaped post-disturbance trajectories whith an amplitude depending on the disturbance intensity. The decoupling between taxonomic and functional response  could be explained by variations in community functional redundancy. The loss of species or the changes in their abundance would impact the taxonomic but not the functional diversity and composition, as redundant species with the same functional characteristics remain in the community. The trajectory of the functional redundancy hence appeared determinant for community recovery.</p>
<div id="decoupled-taxonomic-and-functional-trajectories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decoupled taxonomic and functional trajectories</h2>
<p>From pre-disturbance to 30 years after disturbance, communities showed different location along NMDS axis 2 that hardly changed along time. Specificities in community taxonomic composition, materialized by the distinct location on the NMDS axis 2, existed before disturbance. The disturbance led a displacement on the NMDS axis 1 only. Taxonomic  post-disturbance  changes in composition were similar among plots and may correspond to the recruitment of a group of pioneers, like <em>Cecropia spp.</em> or <em>Miconia spp.</em>, common to all plots, whatever their initial taxonomic specificities  and the intensity of the disturbance <span class="citation">(Julie S Denslow and Guzman 2000; F. Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. Taxonomic trajectories initiated a recovery towards the initial composition. This recovery, although far from being achieved after 30 years, suggested the resilience of community taxonomic composition. Although the composition dramatically changed following disturbance, community specificities were maintained <span class="citation">(C. Folke 2006)</span>. This maintenance suggested that the recruitment came from (i) a common set of pioneer and light-demanding species in all plots that shape the similar trajectories on NMDS axis 1 and (ii) a very local set of late-successional species that signs (and maintains in time) the initial position of each plot on NMDS axis 2. This can be related to species dispersal limitation that is common among tropical species <span class="citation">(Svenning and Wright 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Community functional composition trajectories, in contrast, were similar in the functional space. Such functional convergence contrasting with community taxonomic divergence was already observed in plant communities <span class="citation">(Fukami et al. 2005)</span>. The amplitude of the compositional changes depended on the disturbance intensity. Functional trajectories were probably driven by the recruitment of species infrequent or absent before disturbance, and belonging to a pool of species common to all plots. This common pool was composed of pioneers with “resource-acquisitive”&quot; strategies displaying low leaf toughness, wood specific gravity, maximum height, and high specific leaf area. The recruitment of these pioneers drove a displacement to the right along the first NMDS axis <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. This recruitment went along with an increase of the mean SLA, and a decrease in the mean WSG in disturbed communities (). These fast and significant changes in mean functional traits closely linked to species light acquisition <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Chave et al. 2009)</span> suggested major changes in the light environment following disturbance that shape species assemblage in tropical forests <span class="citation">(M. Peña-Claros et al. 2008; Carreño-Rocabado et al. 2012)</span>. Thereafter, the first recruited pioneers were progressively excluded by long-lived, more competitive, and shade-tolerant species. The recruitment of these late-successional species marked the recovery of the initial functional composition with more “resource-conservative”&quot; strategies, corresponding to a fast decrease in community mean SLA and a stabilisation of community WSG, suggesting the progressive closing of forest canopy.  This recovery translated in the functional plane by a displacement left along the first axis and upward along the second axis (Fig. ).</p>
<p>The decoupling between taxonomic and functional trajectories suggested that simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects shaped tree community assembly in Paracou forest. Tree community assembly would then be both deterministic in the functional space, and historically contingent in the taxonomic space.</p>
<p> We must temper these results with the low number of plots (3) for each treatment. However, the size of each plot is 6.25ha that has been regularly censused over 25 years so that the trajectories have been drawn using 75ha of permanent plot information, a spatial hold very rarely achieved in such studies. Given the relative homogeneity of environmental characteristics of terra firme forests over the Guiana Shield and even the amazonian basin, it seems reasonable that similar trajectories would apply to neighboring areas <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2015; Guitet et al. 2018)</span>. </p>

<div id="the-scope-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The scope of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>Trajectories of taxonomic richness and evenness differed markedly below and above an intensity threshold (Fig. ). For low and intermediate disturbance, both taxonomic richness and evenness increased according to the disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(Martin et al. 2015; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. This suggested that the recruitment of pioneers, previously infrequent or absent, increased the taxonomic richness, and that trees surviving after disturbance remained numerous enough to maintain the richness of the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(F. Bongers et al. 2009)</span>. The pioneers thus recruited became abundant, which balanced the usual hyper-dominance of tropical forests and increased the taxonomic evenness <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. Above the intensity threshold, like for treatment 3 (high intensity), the taxonomic richness did not exceed the initial value in the first years following disturbance. No increase of the taxonomic richness suggested that the richness of surviving trees was lower than this of the pre-disturbance community, and that this difference was not offset by the recruitment of pioneers. In the Guiana shield, the pool of hard  pioneers specifically recruited after disturbance is restricted to a few common genera (e.g. <em>Cecropia spp.</em>, <em>Miconia spp.</em>, <em>Tapirira spp.</em>) <span class="citation">(Guitet et al. 2018)</span>. The disturbance intensity showed a humped-shaped relationship with the post-disturbance increase in taxonomic richness at all the different times after disturbance, and with the increase in taxonomic evenness 10 years after disturbance (Fig. ). Taxonomic richness, and to some extend taxonomic evenness, were maximized at an intermediate intensity, around 20-25% of AGB lost.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy explaining the taxonomic-functional decoupling</h2>
<p>Regarding community functional trajectories (Fig. ), there was no intensity threshold above which the diversity-disturbance relationship changed. The functional diversity kept increasing along with the disturbance intensity, hence the IDH would not apply. Surprisingly, although some species were lost after disturbance, the functional diversity did not decrease in the first place. On the contrary, functional diversity increased, probably following the rapid recruitment of pioneers that were functionally highly different from the pre-disturbance community <span class="citation">(Julie Sloan Denslow 1980; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>.</p>
<p>The loss of species following disturbance, however, decreased the functional redundancy, all the more so that disturbance was intense. All in all, because functional diversity was not lowered by disturbance while functional redundancy was, this means that the species that were lost in disturbance are, on the whole, functionally equivalent to the species that survive the disturbance. This makes functional redundancy a key to understand community dynamics at a functional level. In other words, the high redundancy of tropical forest mean that several species occupy the same functional space, so changes in taxonomic diversity or composition do not necessarily result in changes in community functional characteristics because species are commutable. The loss of a redundant species doesn’t change anything for the community functional characteristics, so functional trajectories do not necessarily track taxonomic ones. This commutability explains the taxonomic-functional decoupling and the fact that the taxonomic diversity-disturbance relationship supports the IDH while it functional diversity do not.<br />
Following disturbance, the redundancy was progressively restored through the replacement of “resource-acquisitive” species by more late-successional “resource-conservative” species functionally closer to the pre-disturbance community. The time for the functional redundancy to recover would hence be important to assess community recovery. </p>
