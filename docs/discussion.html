<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decoupled taxonomic and functional trajectories</h2>
<p>Both communities taxonomic and functional diversity and composition proved resilient, following similar humped shaped trajectories returning towards initial values. The resilience of communities functional structure, that is the most direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>, meant a consistent recovery of ecosystem processes in the long term <span class="citation">(Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. The resilience of communities taxonomy meant the maintenance of their initial differences in composition and diversity, suggesting the existence of multiple stable equilibria as assumed for highly diverse and productive ecosystems <span class="citation">(Chase 2003)</span>, and the dependency of recovery trajectories on the initial composition to be recovered that would the the asymptot of the humped shaped dynamics <span class="citation">(S. P. Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Anderson 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Although both communities taxonomic and functional characteristics proved resilient and followed similar humped shaped trajectories, the taxonomic recovery systematically lagged behind the functional one. The decoupling between functional and taxonomic dynamics has already been observed for grasslands <span class="citation">(D. Tilman 1997; D. Mouillot et al. 2011)</span> and more recently for tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. According to the “vegetation quantity effect” <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span> functional trajectories rely on the pool of dominant species, which diversity and evenness increased after disturbance but rapidly recovered their initial functional structure. Although the pool of dominant species recovered quickly, communities evenness remained high so infrequent species still missed to the taxonomic recovery. Taxonomic recovery was then all the more longer that unrecovered species would be functionally redundant and probably underwent selective competition processes.</p>

<div id="a-validation-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> A validation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>In accordance with the IDH the trajectories confirmed the increase of communities diversity after disturbance with the favored growth of otherwise less favored species. However, although it was clear for the functional diversity this tendency was more blurry regarding communities taxonomic structure.</p>
<p>The taxonomic richness was enhanced after low disturbance but it was weakly or negatively impacted by intense disturbance, as observed on several post logging surveys <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. The taxonomic evenness also increased after disturbance, but the correlation between the disturbance intensity and the diversity increase remained weak and valid only after 20 years (<em>i.e.</em> Simpson diversity).</p>
<p>Contrastingly the functional diversity increase after disturbance was determined by the disturbance intensity all along the 30 years monitored. We already demonstrated that disturbance primarily entailed turnover of specific within communities, either among pre-disturbance survivors or among newly recruited trees. It wasdemonstrated that the composition of old-growth survivors proved to mirror initial communities <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, so disturbance rather impacted trees recruitment with the enhanced growth and survival of previously infrequent species and functional types. Consistently disturbance resulted in an increase of the taxonomic dissimilarity between communities and their pre-disturbance composition, and in significant functional shifts towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf toughness and maximum height) <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Disturbance entailed a reorganization of the typical high dominance structure of hyperdiverse mature forests benefiting to pioneers and light demanding species: the changes in abiotic environment and competitive pressure favored pioneers which outcompete other species in non limiting resources but were excluded in mature forests by long-lived, more resistant and shade tolerant species. Corroborating the IDH, the trajectories after disturbance relied on the environmental niches made available and filled by species from a restrictied functional range. Recruited species therefore differed from pre-disturbance ones, constituting a community all the more diverse that the disturbance was intense <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-functional-redundancy-key-of-communities-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The functional redundancy, key of communities resilience</h2>
<p>Both the lag between taxonomic and functional recovery and the middling consistency of the IDH regarding communities taxonomic diversity were explained by the incomplete recovery of communities functional redundancy, which besides implies that communities resilience remained altered 30 years after disturbance <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Functional redundancy mitigates the loss of species on communities functional structure <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>, and therefore reduces the impact on disturbance. The functional redundancy itself however might be reduced or re-organized within the functional space and alter communities resilience. Although the functional redundancy considered in the whole commnities functional space did not follow consistent trajectories after disturbance, the redundancy restricted to the functional space of the initial community clearly followed humped shaped trajectories. This restricted redundancy first decreased, all the more so that the disturbance was intense, and then returned towards the initial value but this had not recovered for any disturbed community after 30 years. After disturbance communities then differently occupied the functional space, as it was suggested by the shifts observed for the functional diversity and traits trajectories, before recovering the specific highly redundant initial functional space. This increasing redundancy along the trajectory explained the hampered recovery of infrequent species specific to old-growth forests, as they were likely functionally redundant and therefore underwent competitive pressures limiting species functional similarity <span class="citation">(Mayfield and Levine 2010)</span>. The unachieved recovery of the functional redundancy meant a decreased resilience of pre-disturbance communities and an increased of disturbance-specific communities (corresponding to lower richness and higher dominance of pioneer species). After disturbance the chances were therefore higher to have long lasting or self-maintained compositional changes in favor of disturbance resistant species, lianas or epiphytes <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008; Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000; P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>. The recovery was not complete until the functional redundancy and resilience of the initial communities remained altered. Specificaly, such incomplete recovery would threaten the maintenance of species contingent to undisturbed forests and increase the risk of cornerstone species loss and unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; Chazdon 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
