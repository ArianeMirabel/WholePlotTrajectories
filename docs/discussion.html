<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> A validation of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</h2>
<p>The monitoring of disturbed forest communities confirmed a limited negative impact of disturbance on species richness, as observed on several post logging surveys <span class="citation">(Cannon 1998; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. Thirty years after disturbance, the most disturbed plots had recovered their initial genus richness, similar to this of control plots. After low intensity plots the genus richness substantially increased for low intensity plots, reaching a gain of almost 12 genuses for some plots.</p>
<p>The evenness of all disturbed plots and the richness of low disturbance plots on the other hand mainly followed an asymptotic growth sharply increasing until 15 years after disturbance. Such increased evenness is explained by a much more homogeneous species distribution after disturbance. Communities composition after disturbance is either due to the old, pre-disturbance survivors or to the recruited trees. The composition of old survivors proved to mirror the initial community <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>, the observed composition turnover would stem from an enhanced the growth and survival of previously infrequent species which, along with the IDH, reorganizes the typical high dominance structure of hyperdiverse mature forests. This increase in taxonomic diversity was accompanied by an increased taxonomic dissimilarity to initial state along time, translating a a taxonomic turnover benefiting to pioneers and light demanding species, as illustrated by the communities functional shifts towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf toughness and maximum height) <span class="citation">(Westoby 1998; I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014)</span>. Post-disturbance changes in abiotic environment and competitive pressure then well favored pioneers outcompeting other species when abiotic resources are abundant but otherwise excluded in mature forests by long-lived, resistant and shade tolerant species. The trajectories of proportions among seed mass classes besides revealed the enhanced growth of small seeded, large dispersive, species and therefore the importance of species reproductive strategy which further supported the role of species dispersion and demographic strategy for the post-disturbance dynamics, as suggested by the IDH <span class="citation">(TerSteege and Hammond 2001; Flores, Gourlet-Fleury, and Picard 2006; Haddad et al. 2008)</span>.</p>

<div id="on-the-recovery-of-disturbed-communities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> On the recovery of disturbed communities</h2>
<p>The functional diversity followed a hump-back trajectory which maximum was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity and after 30 years, all disturbed plots had recovered diversities close to their initial values. Similar hump-back trajectories were followed by all leaf and stem functional traits and life history traits, to the exception of leaf chlorophyll content. Although the return to initial values was still ongoing the recovery of functional diversity and average communities trait values was undeniable. This translated the recovery of ecosystems processes <span class="citation">(Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>, as functional traits are the most direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning <span class="citation">(S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Same recovery trajectories were followed by taxonomic and functional composition which argued for communities convergence and the maintenance of plots initial difference <span class="citation">(Hubbell et al. 1999; J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. These compositon difference, and probably also some abiotic parameters, besides strongly determined the maximum and time path of the trajectories which, despite an homogeneous trend were quite variable among plots.</p>

<div id="functional-redundancy-of-disturbed-ecosystems" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Functional redundancy of disturbed ecosystems</h2>
<p>Despite the consistent recovery of initial diversity and composition there was a time lag between the communities taxonomic and functional characteristics. Taxonomic composition had longer time path and while communities had recovered their functional diveristy, their taxonomic composition and evenness remained higher than before disturbance. This delay between functional and taxonomic dynamics was already observed for grasslands <span class="citation">(D. Tilman 1997; D. Mouillot et al. 2011)</span> and more recently for tropical forests <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. Communities functional diversity rely, according to the “vegetation quantity effect” <span class="citation">(Grime 1998)</span>, on the functional strategy of dominant species. Communities functional trajectory is then first driven by the increase of dominant species diversity and evenness following disturbance and then by the emergence of recruitment of species progressively resembling the old pre-disturbance community which decreased the diversity. Dominant species then restored the functional diversity and the dominant functional type of the community although the functional and taxonomic composition remained altered and the infrequent species of initial communities are still missing to plots recovery. The functional traits trajectories suggest that those species would match the dominant functional type therefore increasing communities functional redundancy. The functional overlap between species is typical of the huge biodiversity of tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>, and proved far from recovery 03 years after disturbance. It is though a determinant of forests resilience and should be accounted for <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; S Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>Long-term alteration of functional redundancy besides came along with persistent compositional changes which most probably impact disturbance resistant species <span class="citation">(Haddad et al. 2008)</span> and probably lianas or epiphytes <span class="citation">(P. A. Martin, Newton, and Bullock 2013)</span>, and the modification of environmental conditions like soils nutrient cycling and compaction <span class="citation">(Olander, Bustamante, and Asner 2005)</span> forest resilience remains under question <span class="citation">(Chazdon 2003)</span>. New conditions would not only be longer lasting but self-maintained as tied to disturbance regime <span class="citation">(Burslem, Whitmore, and Brown 2000)</span>. Specificaly, this would impair species contingent to undisturbed forests, threatening their maintenance, and run the risk to loose cornerstone species and trigger unexpected ecological consequences <span class="citation">(Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994; S Díaz et al. 2005; Gardner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
