\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial
economic, social and cultural value. They provide wood and multiple
non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate the
local climate, support the carbon, water and nutrient cycles, and ensure
cultural and human well-being. The simultaneous increase of forests
products demand and substantial climatic changes currently heighten the
pressure on the remaining forests
\citep{Gibson2011a, Morales-Hidalgo2015}. It threatens the maintenance
of communities structure, composition and functioning and the underlying
dynamics in space and time \citep{Anderson-Teixeira2013, Sist2015}.

In tropical forest, ecological communities are contantly re-shaped by
the natural disturbance events that changes the abiotic environment,
through the fluxes of light, heat and water, and the biotic interaction
and competitive pressure \emph{(Goulamoussene Biogeosciences)}. The
cornerstone of tropical forests ecology is then to understand the
underlyings of ecosystem response to disturbance, its mechanisms and
drivers \citep{White2001, Chazdon2003a}. For now, this has been largely
studied through structural parameters, rapid and convenient to measure,
as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density
\emph{(e.g.~PiponiotElife, RutishauserBiotropica)}. These structural
parameters have then been sucessfully modeled and allowed to assess the
maintenance of ecosystems processes and services
\citep{Denslow2000, Blanc2009, Rutishauser2016}. However the response of
tree species diversity remains unclear, also it is determinant of
ecosystems productivity, stability and functioning
\citep[Liang2016Science]{Tilman2014} and would be most probably impacted
by post-disturbance environmental changes \citep{BaralotoJAE}.

In the short-term disturbance demonstrated negligible or even positive
impacts on communities diversity, which have been formalized by the
intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) stating a maximized species
diversity at intermediate disturbance intensity
\citep{Molino2001, Kariuki2006a, Berry2008a}. Validations of the IDH in
the long term, however, remain scarce and mainly rely on the analysis of
the rough species richness that gives limited or misleading information
on forests recovery and functioning \citep{Martin2015, Chaudhary2016}.
More releveant monitoring would encompass communities composition, that
is crucial for conservation issues, and diversity profiles, that reveals
ecological rules underlying communities' structure
\citep{Magurran1988, Lavorel2002, Bellwood2006}. Furthermore, the
functional approach accounting for differenes species biological
attributes would be insightful as it reveals the species role in the
post-disturbance trajectory of ecosystems functioning
\citep{Violle2007b, Moretti2009, Baraloto2012a, Scheiter2013}. In that
respect major functional traits related to species ecology and
performance were largely adopted through an integrative framework
\citep{Diaz2005, Villeger2008a}. The functional trait-based approach,
for example, highlighted in tropical rainforests the environmental
filters fostering disturbance resistant species with rapid growth and
efficient resources acquisition \citep{Molino2001, Haddad2008}. In
disturbed tropical rainforests, this framework translates into the
fostering disturbance resistant species with rapid growth and efficient
resources acquisition \citep{Molino2001, Haddad2008} with a shift from
``conservative'' slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources that
dominate before disturbance, to ``acquisitive'' fast-growing species
with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources
\citep{TerSteege2001, Reich2014, Herault2011}. It was mirrored by shifts
in key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf area,
density and chlorophyll content, and stem specific gravity and bark
thickness), tree growth and reproduction life history traits (seed mass
and maximum height) \citep{Wright2004, Westoby2006a, Chave2009b}.

A proper monitoring of communities response should therefore encompass
taxonomic and functional diversity and composition measures to test the
validity of the IDH in the long term for tropical forests, and clarify
the resilience of communities evenness, composition, and also
functioning. The trajectories followed by all these facets would
highlight the role of deterministic processes, like competitive
exclusion or abiotic selection, and the communities' convergence
maintaining intrinsinc differences in diversity and composition,which is
as much insgights for future adaptive conservation strategies
\citep{Adler2007}.

Here we investigated over 30 years the response of 75 ha of forests
plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60\% of
ecosystem biomass removed. We made use of a large functional traits
database browsing major leaf, stem and seed traits and species maximum
height to draw the trajectories over time of communities taxonomic and
functional composition and diversity. Specifically, we (i) tested the
validity of the IDH in the long term for tropical hyperdiverse forest
and highlighted the ecological rules shaping their response to
disturbance, (ii) clarified the different facets of communities
resilience in terms of communities composition, diversity and
functioning \emph{????(iii) questioned the completeness of communities
recovery given the altered functional redundancy.}

\section{Material and Methods}\label{material-and-methods}

\subsection{Study site}\label{study-site}

Paracou station in French Guiana (5°18'N and 52°53'W) is located in a
lowland tropical rain forest corresponding to a tropical wet climate
with mean annual precipitation averaging 2980 mm.y\textsuperscript{-1}
(30-y period) with a 3-month dry season (\textless{} 100
mm.month\textsuperscript{-1}) from mid-August to mid-November, and a
one-month dry season in March \citep{Wagner2011}. Elevation ranges
between 5 and 50 m and mean annual temperature is 26°C. Soils correspond
to thin acrisols over a layer of transformed saprolite with low
permeability generating lateral drainage during heavy rains. The
experiment corresponds to a network of twelve 6.25ha plots that have
undergone a gradient of three logging, thinning and fuelwood treatments
(Table \ref{tab:Tab1}). Disturbance treatments were attributed according
to a randomized plot design with three replicate blocks of four plots.
The disturbance corresponds to averages of 10 trees removed per hectare
with a diameter at 1.3 m height (DBH) above 50 cm for treatment 1 (T1),
32 trees/ha above 40 cm DBH for treatment 2 (T2) and 40 trees above 40
cm DBH for treatment 3 (T3). Treatments T2 and T3 besides included the
thinning of trees by poison girdling \citep{Blanc2009}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Inventories protocol and dataset
collection}\label{inventories-protocol-and-dataset-collection}

The study site corresponds to a tropical rainforest with a dominance of
Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae botanical
families. In the twelve experimental plots of the experiment, all trees
above 10 cm DBH were mapped and measured annually since 1984. During
inventories, trees were first identified with a vernacular name assigned
by the field team, and afterward with a scientific name assigned by a
botanist during regular botanical campaigns. In 1984, specific
vernacular names were given to 62 commercial or common species whereas
other less common species were identified under two identifiers only
separating trees and palm trees. The botanical campaigns carried every 5
to 6 years to identify all trees at the species level only started in
2003 and identification practices varied among plots and successive
campaigns. This raised methodological issues as vernacular names usually
correspond to different botanical species, resulting in significant
taxonomic uncertainties that had to be propagated to composition and
diversity metrics through a Bayesian framework. The uncertainty
propagation was done by the replenishment of inventories completed at
genus level from real incomplete ones on the basis of
vernacular/botanical names association.

Vernacular names were replaced through multinomial trials
\(M_v\Big(\big[s_1, s_2, …, s_N\big],\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,…, \alpha_3\big]\Big)\)
based on the observed association probability
\(\big[\alpha_1, \alpha_2,…, \alpha_3\big]\) between each vernacular
name \emph{v} and the species \(\big[s_1, s_2, …, s_N\big]\) recorded in
the inventory. See appendix 1 and \citet{Aubry-Kientz2013} for the
detailed methodology.

The functional diversity metrics used a dataset for 6 functional traits
representing leaf economics (leaves thickness, toughness, total
chlorophyll content and specific leaf area, the leaf area per unit dry
mass) and wood economics (wood specific gravity and bark thickness), and
life history traits (maximum specific height and seed mass).

The trait database came from the BRIDGE project \footnote{http://www.ecofog.gf/Bridge/}
where trait values were assessed from a selection of individuals located
in nine permanent plots in French Guiana, including two in Paracou.
Missing trait values were filled using multivariate imputation by
chained equation (mice) restricted to samples pertaining to the next
higher taxonomic level, in order to account for the phylogenetic signal
of the functional traits. The dataset comprised 294 botanical species
pertaining to 157 botanical genera.

Whenever a species inventoried was not in the dataset, it was attributed
a set of traits values randomly sampled among species of the same next
higher taxonomic level. As seed mass information corresponds to a
classification into mass classes, no data filling process was applied so
analysis were performed considering the 414 botanical species of the
seed mass dataset. All composition and diversity metrics corresponded to
the average obtained after 50 iterations of the taxonomic uncertainty
propagation framework and of the filling process of missing trait
values.

\subsection{Composition and diversity
metrics}\label{composition-and-diversity-metrics}

To counter the remaining taxonomic uncertainty, plots taxonomic
composition and diversity were analysed at the genus level, \emph{i.e.}
referring to the genus of observed or trialed botanical names.
Variations in plots taxonomic and functional composition after
disturbance was visualized by their trajectories in a two-dimensional
ordination space over 30 years. Two NMDS were conducted, either from
taxonomic flora inventories or from plots functional composition based
on the 8 leaf, stem and life history traits. Plots trajectories along
time was reported comparatively to the inventories in 1989, 5 years
after disturbance, which corresponded to first inventory with a
sufficient degree of uncertainty (\textless{}30\% of undetermined
trees). The inventories dissimilarity compared to the reference 1989
inventory was reported using occurrence-based (Jaccard) and
abundance-based (Bray-Curtis) similarity measures. The trajectory of
inventories along time was visualized with the euclidean distance in the
two-dimensional ordination space to the 1989 inventory. The trajectories
of the leaf and stem and life traits were also visualized with the
community weighted means (CWM), representing the average trait value in
a community weighted by relative abundance of the species carrying each
value \citep{Diaz2007, Garnier2004}. To compensate the intrinsinc
difference among plots the trajectories corresponded to the differences
along time with the reference inventory in 1989. Species seed mass
corresponded to 5 classes of increasing mass, seed mass trajectories
were therefore reported as the proportion of each class in the
inventories.

The taxonomic diversity was assessed through Richness and the Hill
number translation of Shannon and Simpson indices \citep{Hill1973}.
These three indices belong to the set of HCDT or generalized entropy,
respectively corresponding to the 0, 1 and 2 order of diversity (q),
which proved well suited for diversity studies
\citep{Patil1982, Tothmeresz1995}. The functional diversity was reported
using the Rao index of quadratic entropy which combines species
abundance distribution and average pairwise dissimilarity based on all
functional and life traits.

The functional redundancy was measured as the overlap among species in
communities' functional space \citep{Carmona2016}. The samples of the
trait database were first located with a PCA analysis in a
two-dimensional functional space summarizing the 8 functional traits
considered. We choose to summarize species functional space through a
PCA because functional traits considered were already somehow redundant
and allows not to overweight the role of one trait. Then, multivariate
kernel density estimator associated with individual trees were summed to
give the distribution of traits probabilites of each species. For each
community the trait probability distributions of corresponding species
were combined and weighted by species abundance. Eventually communities
functional redundancy was measured as the sum of overlap between species
weighted functional density. Communities functional redundancy is
expressed as the average number of species that could be removed from
the community without reducing the functional space.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Disturbance impacts on communities composition and average
functional traits
values}\label{disturbance-impacts-on-communities-composition-and-average-functional-traits-values}

\subsubsection{Composition trajectories}\label{composition-trajectories}

Over time, 828388 trees and 591 botanical species pertaining to 223
genus and 64 botanical families were recorded. Taxonomic and functional
plots trajectories were examined through the trajecotries in a two
dimensional ordination space of successive inventories from 1989 (5
years after disturbance) to 2015 (31 years after disturbance).
Classifications were performed using either abundance-based Bray-Curtis
(Figure \ref{fig:NMDSplans}) or incidence-based Jaccard dissimilarity,
this last having given similar results (data not shown).

Both taxonomic and functional composition of disturbed plots followed
consistent trajectories over time, translating compositional changes
while control plots remained stable. The addition of functional traits
in the two dimensional space revealed a shift of plots composition
towards more acquisitive functional strategies (disturbed plots changed
from high average WD to high average SLA and chlorophyll content). The
dissimilarity of the successive inventories for disturbed plots compared
to their respective reference inventory in 1989 followed unimodal
trajectories (AppendixI, Figure A2). The maximum dissimilarity of plot
strajectories was positively correlated to the disturbance intensity for
taxonomic (\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.91\)) as well as functional
composition (\(\rho_{spearman}^{taxonomic}=0.96\)). The time at maximum
dissimilarity for taxonomic composition was reached around 26 years
after disturbance while it was 22 years for functional composition. All
trajectories returned towards the initial composition and translated
cyclic compositional changes as visualized in figure (Figure
\ref{fig:NMDSplans}).

\begin{figure}

Distance matrix for NMDS were computed from the Bray-curtis dissimilarity between successive inventories. Line colors represent the disturbance treatment (green for control, blue for T1,orange for T2 and red for T3).}\label{fig:NMDSplans}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Traits community weighted
means}\label{traits-community-weighted-means}

The changes observed in plots functional composition went hand to hand
with consistent trajectories of the 8 functional and life history traits
(Leaf thickness, chlorophyll content, toughness and specific area, wood
specific gravity and bark thickness and seed mass and maximum adult
height) visualized with plots community weighted means (CWM) (Figure
\ref{fig:CWM}).

Except for leaf cholorphyll content, which continued to increase for
some T3 and T2 plots 30 years after disturbance, all traits and seed
mass proportions displayed a unimodal trajectories. The weighted means
of communities specific maximum height at adult stage (\emph{Hmax}),
leaf toughness (\emph{L\_toughness}) and wood specific gravity
(\emph{WD}) remained significantly lower than their initial value and
than these of the control plots (Figure \ref{fig:CWM}). The weighted
means of bark thickness (\emph{Bark\_thick}) similarly remained
substantilly higher than initially for all disturbed plots while the
specfic leaf area (\emph{SLA}) had almost recovered its initial value
and this of the undisturbed plots at the end of the experiment. Once
again the maximum difference to initial state was correlated to the
disturbance intensity (\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{thickness}}=0.67\),
\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{chloro}}=0.45\),
\(\rho_{spearman}^{L_{toughness}}=-0.43\),
\(\rho_{spearman}^{SLA}=0.93\), \(\rho_{spearman}^{WD}=-0.78\),
\(\rho_{spearman}^{Bark-thickness}=0.88\),
\(\rho_{spearman}^{Hmax}=-0.48\)).

\begin{figure*}

Trajectories correspond to the median (solid line) and 0.025 and 0.975 percentile (gray envelope) observed after 50 iteration of the taxonomic uncertainty propagation and the missing trait value filling processes. Initial treatments are represented by solid lines colors with green for control, blue for T1,orange for T2 and red for T3.}\label{fig:CWM}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Trajectories of communities diversity after
disturbance}\label{trajectories-of-communities-diversity-after-disturbance}

\subsubsection{Taxonomic diversity}\label{taxonomic-diversity}

Trajectories of Richness, Shannon and Simpson taxonomic diversity were
examined at genus level in relation to the 1989 inventories (5 years
after disturbance) (Figure \ref{fig:DivTaxo}).

\begin{figure*}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{WholePlotTrajectories_files/figure-latex/DivTaxo-1} 

}

\caption{Trajectories of the difference to the 1989 inventories (5 years after disturbance) over 30 years after disturbance of plots communities \textbf{(a)} Richness, \textbf{(b)} Shannon and \textbf{(c)} Simpson diversities. Trajectories correspond to the median (solid line) and 0.025 and 0.975 percentile (gray envelope) observed after 50 iteration of the taxonomic uncertainty propagation. Initial treatments are represented by solid lines colors with green for control, blue for T1,orange for T2 and red for T3.}\label{fig:DivTaxo}
\end{figure*}

For undisturbed plots the Richness, Shannon and Simpson diversities
remained stable over the 30 monitored years. After disturbance the
richness increased when the disturbance intensity was low, with a
maximum increase of 14 botanical genera (plot 3 from treatment 2). When
the disturbance was intense however, plots taxonomic richness followed a
unimodal decrease with a return to initial values after intense
disturbance. The taxonomic evenness (Shannon and Simpson diversities)
significantly increased irrespective of the disturbance intensity. The
evenness followed a unimodal trajectory with a just beginning return
towards initial values and a maximum reached around 20 years and
positively correlated to the disturbance intensity
(\(\rho_{spearman}^{Shannon}=0.86\), and
\(\rho_{spearman}^{Simpson}=0.89\)). Only two T3 plots, plots 8 and 12,
remained increasing 30 years after disturbance \ref{fig:DivTaxo}),
suggesting a similar be much delayed unimodal trajectory.

\subsubsection{Functional diversity}\label{functional-diversity}

The functional diversity trajectories of plots based on the 8 leaf, stem
and life history traits was examined through the Rao diversity. For all
undisturbed plots the functional diversity remained comparable to the
reference values 5 years after disturbance (1989 inventories). For all
disturbed plots the functional trajectories followed a unimodal
trajectory with a maximum positively correlated to disturbance intensity
(\(\rho_{spearman}=0.73\)) (Figure \ref{fig:DivFun}). The plot 7 from
treatment 1 that displayed a constantly outlying diversity was removed
from the graphical representation for better readability, see appendix
for full graph. Thirty years after disturbance all plots, whenever the
initial disturbance intensity, regained diversity values similar to
their initial value and to those of control plots.

The functional redundancy was measured as the sum of weighted overlap
among species in the communities. Species functional space were defined
in the main two-dimensional space of a PCA analysis based on all leaf
and stem and maximum height traits (see appendix I for more details).
Plots functional redundancy compared to the initial value after logging
so that only communities dynamics are followed apart from the impact of
logging itself. Communities functional redundancy remained stable in
control plots but after disturbance the redundancy trajectories were
quite variable (See appendix I). Globally after most intense disturbance
(plots T2 and T3) communities redundancy decreased at first place and
then increased to edge, recover or even exceed the initial value.
Considering the functional redundancy restricted to the functional space
of the initial inventory, though, all disturbed plots followed similar
decreasing humped-shaped trajectories (\ref{fig:RedFun}). The maximum
redundancy loss observed was positively correlated with the disturbance
intensity (XX spearman to be measured) and none of the disturbed plots
had recovered the functional redundancy within their initial functional
space.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsection{A validation of the intermediate disturbance
hypothesis}\label{a-validation-of-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis}

The monitoring of disturbed forest communities confirmed a limited
negative impact of disturbance on species richness, as observed on
several post logging surveys \citep{Cannon1998, Baraloto2012a}. Thirty
years after disturbance, the genus richness was restored to initial plot
values after high disturbance intensity while it substantially increased
after low disturbance intensity, reaching a gain of almost 12 genera for
some plots.

Both richness and evenness followed asymptotic trajectories after
disturbance, sharply increasing for 15 years before stabilizing at
higher values than those of control plots. An increase of communities
evenness stems from a higher homogeneity of species distribution. After
disturbance, communities are made of the old, pre-disturbance survivors
and the newly recruited trees: changes in composition and abundance
distribution are to be found in the recruitment processes and in the
pre-disturbance survivors mortality. Because the composition of old
survivors proved to mirror the initial community \citep{Herault2018}, a
specific turnover was expected among recruited trees with enhanced
growth and survival of previously infrequent species. Indeed, the
increase in taxonomic diversity was accompanied by an increase of
taxonomic dissimilarity with plots initial state and a functional shift
towards resource-acquisitive strategies (sharp increase in the SLA, leaf
thickness and bark thickness and decrease in wood density, leaf
toughness and maximum height)
\citep{Westoby1998, Wright2004, Reich2014}. Disturbance then causes a
reorganization of the typical high dominance structure of hyperdiverse
mature forests after disturbance, benefiting to pioneers and light
demanding species. Likely, the changes in abiotic environment and
competitive pressure favored pioneers which outcompete others in non
limiting resources but are excluded in mature forests by long-lived,
more resistant and shade tolerant species.

As stated by the IDH, communities dynamics after disturbance relied on
species functional strategy and corresponding ability to fill the
environmental niches made available by disturbance. Recruited species
then mixed with pre-disturbance ones, from which they differed, and
constituted a community all the more diversified that the disturbance
was intense \citep{Molino2001}.

\subsection{On the recovery of disturbed
communities}\label{on-the-recovery-of-disturbed-communities}

All diversity and composition trajectories followed similar hump-back
trajectories returning towards their initial values. Communities
trajectories therefore illustrated their taxonomic and function
resilience.

Because functional traits and functional diversity are the most direct
link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning \citep{Diaz2005},
their resilience meant a consistent recovery of ecosystem processes in
the long term \citep{Guariguata2001}. The resilience of the taxonomic
diversity and composition similarly translated the recovery of
communities such as before disturbance. This resilience meant the
maintenance of communities initial differences in composition and
supported the idea of their convergence towards a determined state
\citep{Hubbell1999, Molino2001, Baraloto2012a}. If all plots followed
similar hump-back trajectories, though, some significant differences
emerged. To name but one, the taxonomic evenness of one plot displayed
an extensive increase until 30 years after disturbance. The differences
trajectories maxima and time path, along with the fact intrinsinc
communities differences are maintained, suggested that the trajectories
depend on the initial plots composition or on some abiotic parameters
\citep{Anderson2007}.

\subsection{Functional redundancy of disturbed
ecosystems}\label{functional-redundancy-of-disturbed-ecosystems}

Despite the recovery of pre-disturbance state there was a time lag
between the trajectories followed by communities taxonomic and
functional characteristics. The trajectory of taxonomic composition and
evenness had a longer time-path and remained altered while communities
functional composition and diversity had already recovered.

Such delay between functional and taxonomic dynamics was already
observed for grasslands \citep{Tilman1997, Mouillot2011} and more
recently for tropical forests \citep{Lohbeck2015, Guariguata2001}.
According to the ``vegetation quantity effect'' \citep{Grime1998}, the
functional diversity of communities rely on the dominant species.
Communities functional trajectories were then driven first by the
increase in diversity and evenness of dominant species, which restored
the pre-disturbance functional characteristics. Then, the functional
trajectories were driven by the recruitment of species resembling the
old pre-disturbance community, which reduced the overall diversity. At
that time, the taxonomic composition and diversity remained altered: the
still missing species were then the initially infrequent and
functionally redundant ones. The functional redundancy, the functional
overlap between species that is typical of the huge biodiversity of
tropical forests \citep{Bellwood2006}, was then not restored 30 years
after disturbance and this is major to consider as it defines forests'
resilience \citep{Trenbath1999, Elmqvist2003, Diaz2005}.

Besides the long-term alteration of functional redundancy, there was
probably persistent compositional changes favoring disturbance resistant
species \citep{Haddad2008}, lianas or epiphytes \citep{Martin2013} and
environmental changes, like in the soils nutrient cycling and compaction
\citep{Olander2005}. These persistent changes highly question forest's
resilience \citep{Chazdon2003a}. New conditions would not only be longer
lasting but self-maintained as tied to disturbance regime
\citep{Burslem2000}. Specificaly, this would impair species contingent
to undisturbed forests, threatening their maintenance, and run the risk
to loose cornerstone species and trigger unexpected ecological
consequences \citep{Jones1994, Diaz2005, Gardner2007}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Our study showed the significant impact of disturbance on tropical
forests communities and validated the consistency of the IDH in the long
term. It revealed the contrasting response of communities taxonomic and
functional characteristics, with persisting impacts on the species
abundance distibution while the functional diversity and dominant
functional strategies were restored. Communities recovery therefore
remained unachieved but consistent for the range of disturbance studied
here. The length of the recovery, however, severly questioned the
sustainability of intense selective logging and advocated felling cycle
much longer than 30 years \citep{Gourlet-Fleury2005}.
