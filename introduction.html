<p>Understanding the ecological rules underlying the maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global changing context. The huge diversity of tropical forests is often assumed to be shaped by constant regime of disturbance yielding a diversity peak at intermediate intensity, but for tropical forests this intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) remains debated, and this controversy also questions the extent of communities resilience regarding their functional and taxonomic facets is also to be clarified. To disentangle the ecological processes driving communities response to disturbance we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity trajectories following a logging and thinning disturbance gradient. Specifically we examined over 30 years the trajectories of communities taxonomic richness and evennes and functional composition, diversity and redundancy based on 7 leaf, stem and life history traits. Trajectories highlighted communities taxonomic resilience, maintaining their initial differences in composition, and functional resilience through fast functional trajectory common to all communities in the functional space. The IDH consistently predicted communities functional trajectories according to the disturbance intensity, but poorly represented their taxonomic trajectories, blurried by the alteration of the functional redundancy and the recruitment of infrequent, shade tolerant species slowed by competitive exclusion processes. Although communities functioning had recovered after 30 years their taxonomic diversity and composition in infrequent species and their functional redundancy remained altered. these results acknowledged the need of decades-long recovery cycles to ensure communities complete resilience, and questioned communities maintenance after repeated disturbance.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate the local climate, and the carbon, water and nutrient cycles, and ensure cultural and human well-being. The growing demand in forests products together with current climatic changes increases the pressure on remaining forests <span class="citation">(Gibson et al. 2011; Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span> and threatens the maintenance and dynamics in space and time of communities structure, composition and functioning <span class="citation">(Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In tropical forest, ecological communities are constantly re-shaped by natural disturbance events that change both the abiotic environment, through the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>, and the biotic interactions like competition among species <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Chesson2000"><strong>???</strong></span>; Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. One of the cornerstone of tropical forest ecology is to understand the processes and drivers of ecosystems response to disturbance <span class="citation">(White and Jentsch 2001; Chazdon 2003)</span>. For now, this has been largely studied through forest structural parameters, rapid and convenient to measure, as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. These structural parameters were thereafter sucessfully modeled, giving important insights into the recovery of ecosystems processes and services <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. However the response of forests diversity is still unclear, albeit it determines the productivity, stability and functioning of ecosystems <span class="citation">(David Tilman, Isbell, and Cowles 2014, <span class="citation">Liang et al. (2016)</span>)</span> and would be most probably impacted by the changes induced by disturbance <span class="citation">(Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>In the short-term, moderate disturbance may lead to positive impacts on communities diversity, which have been formalized by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) stating a maximized species diversity at intermediate disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Kariuki et al. 2006; Berry et al. 2008)</span>. Still, validations of the IDH remain scarce in the long term and mainly rely on the analysis of species richness that gives limited or misleading information on forests recovery and functioning <span class="citation">(Philip A. Martin et al. 2015; Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. More complete analysis would besides encompass communities composition that is crucial for conservation issues, and abundance distribution to reveal the ecological rules structuring communities <span class="citation">(Magurran 1988; Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>. Furthermore, a functional approach accounting for species biological attributes and role in the ecosystem directly links ecosystems biodiversity, functioning and environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Moretti et al. 2009; Baraloto et al. 2012; Scheiter, Langan, and Higgins 2013)</span>. The functional trait-based approach focused on major traits related to species ecology and performance was sucessfully adopted <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005; Villéger, Mason, and Mouillot 2008)</span>, for example to reveal in tropical rainforests the deterministic processes that foster after disturbance the fast growing species with efficient resources acquisition <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001; Haddad et al. 2008; Rüger et al. 2009)</span>. This basic deterministic process entails a functional shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources to “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(TerSteege and Hammond 2001; Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into consistent trajectories of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf area, density and chlorophyll content, and stem specific gravity and bark thickness), tree growth and reproduction life history traits (seed mass and maximum height) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>. Besides communities functional composition and diversity, a last key aspect of communities response to disturbance is the changes in functional redundancy that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. High functional redundancy, as in the very diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>, mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines communities resilience <span class="citation">(Trenbath 1999; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. High functional redundancy also increases the functional overlap among species and would foster neutral stochastic processes <span class="citation">(Gravel et al. 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>To grasp all facets of communities response to disturbance we examined here the taxonomic and functional trajectories in diversity and composition <span class="citation">(Lohbeck et al. 2015; Guariguata and Ostertag 2001)</span>. These trajectories would highlight the recovery of communities initial composition, diversity and functioning and the underlying ecological processes. They would clarify the tenants in the long term of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis debated in tropical forests, and provide indications for future adaptive conservation strategies <span class="citation">(Adler, HilleRislambers, and Levine 2007)</span>. We monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of ecosystem biomass removed. We made use of a large functional traits database browsing major leaf, stem and seed functional traits and species maximum height to draw the trajectories over time of communities taxonomic and functional composition and diversity. Specifically, we (i) questioned the coupling between taxonomic and functional response to disturbance and identified the underlying assembly processes, (ii) clarified the validity of the IDH in the long term for tropical forest and (iii) questioned the completeness of communities recovery regarding communities functional redundancy.</p>
