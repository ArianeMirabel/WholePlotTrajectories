Understanding the ecological rules underlying the maintenance of tropical forests biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics is urgent to anticipate their fate in the global change context. The huge diversity of tropical forests is often assumed to be regularly reshaped by natural disturbance yielding a diversity peak at intermediate intensity. This intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), though, remains debated and the resilience of community taxonomic and functional diversity and composition remains controversial. To disentangle the ecological processes driving community response to disturbance, we analyzed tree community trajectories following a disturbance gradient in a Neotropical forest. We examined community diversity, composition and redundancy trajectories over 30 years, considering both taxonomic and functional trajectories based on 7 leaf, stem and life-history traits. We highlighted the cyclic recovery of community taxonomic and functional composition. While pre-disturbance taxonomic differences were maintained over time, functional composition trajectories were quite similar among communities. The IDH did predict community taxonomic diversity response while functional diversity was enhanced whatever the disturbance intensity. Although consistent, the recovery of community composition, diversity and redundancy remained unachieved after 30 years. This acknowledged the need of decades-long cycles with no disturbance to ensure a complete recovery, and questioned tropical forest community resilience after repeated disturbances.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The large areas covered with tropical forests worldwide hold crucial environmental, economic and social values. They provide wood and multiple non-timber forest products, shelter a diversified fauna, regulate the local and regional climates, the carbon, water and nutrient cycles, and ensure cultural and human well-being. The growing demand in forests products together with current global changes, however, increase the pressure on remaining natural forests <span class="citation">(Morales-Hidalgo, Oswalt, and Somanathan 2015)</span>. This changing context alters the natural disturbance regime that shape and maintain tree community structure, composition and functioning <span class="citation">(Schnitzer and Carson 2001; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2013; Sist et al. 2015)</span>, so anticipate the fate of tropical forests requires to understand community response to disturbance. Disturbance initiate ecological succession comprising a suit of changes in community structure and functioning over time, which rate, endpoint an duration depend on the disturbance intensity <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Chazdon2003"><strong>???</strong></span>; Willig and Presley 2018)</span>. Regarding tropical forests, community response to disturbance would be secondary succession, starting with an intact soil and a consistent seed bank, from which we aim would be to highlight predictable trajectories and their underlying ecological processes.</p>
<p>Disturbance change both community abiotic and biotic environments, through modifications in the fluxes of light, heat and water <span class="citation">(Goulamoussène et al. 2017)</span>, and modifications in species interactions, mainly through modifications of species density <span class="citation">(Chesson 2000)</span>. For now, post-disturbance response has been largely studied through forest structural parameters, rapid and convenient to measure, such as aboveground biomass, tree height or stem density <span class="citation">(Piponiot et al. 2016; Rutishauser et al. 2016)</span>. Thereafter, models based on the observed trajectories after disturbance gave important insights into community recovery and resilience <span class="citation">(Hérault and Piponiot 2018)</span>. Regarding community diversity and composition, however, post-disturbance trajectories have not been as thoroughly understood. A leading idea on how the impacts of disturbance on community diversity is the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) <span class="citation">(Connell 1978)</span>. The IDH assumes biodiversity changes in relation to disturbance intensity and frequency, with diversity peaks for intermediate intensity and at intermediate time after disturbance. At intermediate level of disturbance, the fluctuation of environmental conditions entails deterministic processes favoring both competitively superior species and fast colonizers, hence preventing competitive exclusion <span class="citation">(Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004; Pulsford, Lindenmayer, and Driscoll 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>The IDH then assumes both predictable trajectories depending on the disturbance intensity, and, without additional disturbance, the recovery of pre-disturbance state defined by the dominance of late-successional species <span class="citation">(Rees et al. 2001; Sheil and Burslem 2003; Willig and Presley 2018)</span>. In highly diverse tropical forests, however, the validation of the IDH remains controversial <span class="citation">(Fox 2013; Sheil and Burslem 2013)</span> and observed post-disturbance trajectories are often blurry compared to theoretical expectations <span class="citation">(Randall Hughes et al. 2007)</span>. Empirical evidence generally rely on the analysis of a single diversity metric, often the taxonomic richness <span class="citation">(J. F. Molino and Sabatier 2001)</span>, which might give limited or misleading information on community disturbance response. The IDH pattern of diversity peak under an intermediate disturbance regime can indeed result from various ecological processes <span class="citation">(Sheil and Burslem 2003)</span>. To disentangle these various processes and grasp the different facets of community response to disturbance it is crucial to combine a suitable range of approaches <span class="citation">(Shea, Roxburgh, and Rauschert 2004)</span>. More ecological-meaningful analysis would first couple taxonomic richness and evenness, which reveals the changes in species abundance distribution and hence in the underlying ecological processes <span class="citation">(Chaudhary et al. 2016)</span>. Analysis would as well include taxonomic composition, which is crucial for conservation issues <span class="citation">(Lavorel and Garnier 2002; Bellwood et al. 2006)</span>. Eventually, including a functional approach accounting for species biological attributes would be highly revealing of ecological process involved in community response to disturbance. The functional trait-based approach indeed directly links community diversity, composition and redundancy to ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints <span class="citation">(Violle et al. 2007; Baraloto et al. 2012)</span>. In that respect, a vast literature allowed recognizing major traits related to species ecology and mediating species performance in a given environment <span class="citation">(Díaz et al. 2005)</span>. Specifically in tropical forests, the functional approach revealed the post-disturbance deterministic processes entailing a shift from a dominance of “conservative” slow-growing species dealing with scarce resources, to a dominance of “acquisitive” fast-growing species with rapid and efficient use of abundant resources <span class="citation">(Reich 2014; Hérault et al. 2011)</span>. This shift is translated into the trajectories of average community value of key functional traits related to resource acquisition (leaf and stem traits) and life-history strategy (seed mass, maximum size) <span class="citation">(I. J. Wright et al. 2004; Díaz et al. 2005; Steege et al. 2006; Westoby and Wright 2006; Chave et al. 2009)</span>. The functional approach would eventually be completed with the analysis of functional redundancy that quantifies the amount of shared trait values among species <span class="citation">(Carmona et al. 2016)</span>. The high functional redundancy of hyper-diverse tropical forests <span class="citation">(Bellwood et al. 2006)</span> mitigates the impacts of species removal on ecosystem functioning and determines the resilience of communities after disturbance <span class="citation">(Elmqvist et al. 2003; Díaz et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, we monitored over 30 years the response of 75 ha of Neotropical forest plots set up on a gradient of disturbance intensity, from 10 to 60% of ecosystem above-ground biomass (AGB) loss. We made use of a large functional traits database encompassing major leaf, stem and life-history traits in order to draw the taxonomic and functional trajectories in terms of richness, evenness, composition and redundancy. Specifically, we (i) elucidated community taxonomic and functional recovery and the underlying ecological processes, (ii) clarified the validity of the IDH in the long term for tropical forest and its translation into different trajectories in time, and (iii) examined community recovery time.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Rees et al. (2001)</span>]. Yet, observed trajectories proved to often deviate from predictions and from the recovery of initial state and thus evidenced the interplay of stochastic processes <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Hubbel2001"><strong>???</strong></span>; Norden et al. 2015; Norden et al. 2017)</span>. The debate underlying the study of community response to disturbance is now on the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes, and on the nature of ecological rules and mechanisms they generate.</p>
<p>Specifically, the determinism of post-disturbance trajectories is the base of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) which is assumed to be a determinant of tropical forest biodiversity <span class="citation">(Connell 1978)</span>.</p>
